The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species 10 10 The Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi  since its establishment in 1996  has continuously strived to protect  endangered  species  and  habitats  through  a  suite  of  initiatives   which  includes  establishment  of  protected    areas. Species and habitat specific research and monitoring programmes have provided valuable data on their   status and trend. Today we boast of a large population of Dugong  the second largest in the world in the  Arabian Gulf  the largest population of the Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin and the only breeding colony of  the Greater Flamingo in the Arabian Gulf. However   biodiversity  in  the  emirate  faces  some  unique  challenges   especially  from  the  rapid  pace  of   development.  Abu  Dhabi  has  seen  an  unprecedented  growth   both  in  the  population  and  associated   infrastructure in the past three decades. This has put enormous pressure on biodiversity  as a direct result  of development as well as from pollution and invasive species proliferation. Fortunately   Abu  Dhabi  has  also  undertaken  series  of  initiatives  to  protect  biodiversity  and  habitats.  We   currently have a network of 19 protected areas under the Sheikh Zayed Protected Areas Network covering  over  30  %  of  our  land  and  sea  areas.  Our  long-term  research  and  monitoring  programmes  provide  vital   knowledge on the status and trends of important terrestrial and marine species. Such long-term data are key  to  understand  trends  in  populations  and  take  corrective  actions.  We  have  made  best  use  of  such  data   collected over the 25 years of our existence as an input to this red listing process  the outcome of which is   the first red list of species for Abu Dhabi Emirate.   The publication of the Abu Dhabi Red List of Species which has been over due is not only needed but timely.  The Red List would help us identify and develop priority conservation actions for species which are threatened    but would also provide critical inputs to the next five year strategy 2021-2025 and also in the permitting   process.  I  congratulate  the  team  for  working  and  producing  this  Red  List  which  would  go  a  long  way  in   improving the conservation status of some of our most threatened species.  The Emirate of Abu Dhabi is biologically rich   despite the fact that much of the land area is vast  expanse of desert. The emirate takes pride in the  natural heritage it has and has taken extra efforts  to ensure that it is well protected and continues  to provide valuable services  as well as remain   an integral part of Abu Dhabi’s cultural heritage.

19%   10% 10% 13% 11% 37%  The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species 1312 The development of the Abu Dhabi Red List of Species (AD-RLS) is an outcome of a workshop held in 2018   to provide first hand training to EAD staff during a five-day period. The training sessions were conducted by   four  staff  from  Provita   one  from  IUCN  Species  Survival  Commission  and  one  from  the  Red  List  Unit  in   Cambridge. The training provided opportunity to EAD staff to interact with assessors and understand the  process of species assessments in order to assess the taxa in their areas of specialisation.  The  assessment  of  the  selected  taxa  of  Abu  Dhabi   Emirate was skewed towards terrestrial species and  only  nine  key  marine  vertebrate  species  were   assessed   including  Dugongs   (Dugong  dugon)    marine   turtles    (Chelonia  mydas   Eretmochelys  imbricata)   and   dolphins  (Tursiops aduncus  Sousa plumbea).  Several of  the  bird  species  assessed  also  could  be  considered   partly marine as they use coastal and marine habitats.  Of  the  74  threatened  species  32  %  were  coastal    marine  or  wetland  dependent  or  wetland  obligates   and  the  remaining  67  %  terrestrial.  Fortunately   for   many  of  the  threatened  species  there  are  existing   conservation  actions  underway   such  as  monitoring   of  dugongs   turtles   dolphins  and  their  habitats.   Similarly  long-term  monitoring  and  conservation   actions  are  also  underway  for  many  species  of   threatened birds such as Egyptian Vulture  (Neophron  percnopterus)    Socotra  Cormorant   (Phalacrocorax  nigrogularis)   Crab Plover  (Dromas ardeola)  and Sooty  Falcon  (Falco  concolor) .  Plans  are  in  place  for   rehabilitation  for  some  of  the  threatened  plant   species  such  as  White  Saxaul   (Haloxylon  persicum)    and  Dwarf  Palm   (Nannorrhops  ritchieana).   Conser- vation programmes on terrestrial mammals such as  Arabian Oryx  (Oryx leucoryx)   Sand Cat  (Felis margarita  thinobia)  and Arabian Tahr  (Arabitragus jayakari)  are in  place.  Regular  monitoring  of  invertebrates  in  the   emirate has led to the discovery of many new species  to science.   Although significant progress has been made towards   understanding  conservation  status  of  some  key   species   the  current  red  list  of  threatened  species   would lead to conservation actions for species which  have not been part of conservation actions and also   help in redefining conservation priorities for species   which  have  been  subjected  to  some  research  and   assessment already. The publication of this list would  further help EAD as it is in the process of developing   a new five-year strategy (2021-2025). The Abu Dhabi   Red List of species would be a key input in development  planning  processes   especially  when  this  list  is   integrated  with  the  Red  List  of  Ecosystems  and  the   new habitat map  likely to be ready by mid 2021. The local assessment of the Red List of Abu Dhabi  is one of the few such attempts in the region  where local   Red Lists have been developed. Post-training workshop  the team identified a tentative list of 327 species   which included 95 plants  75 birds  9 marine species  30 terrestrial mammals  18 terrestrial reptile and 100  invertebrates. Of these the team assessed 244 species which included 101 plants  49 birds  9 marine species   32 terrestrial mammals  25 invertebrates  26 reptiles and two amphibians.  Of the 244 species assessed  74 are under threat categories (species listed as critically endangered  endangered  or vulnerable) in Abu Dhabi.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species 1918   1918 The emirate is blessed with rich diversity of  habitats within a relatively small and harsh   arid  environment.  EAD  has  identified  12   critical  habitats  and  8  environmentally   sensitive habitats within Abu Dhabi Emirate  (Al Dhaheri  et.al  2017). These  habitats  and  their  sub-habitats  within   are   largely responsible for species richness and diversity  in  the  emirate.  Coastal  habitats  and  the  series  of   islands  as well as the mainland  are home to a large  number  of  resident  and  migratory  species.  Many   offshore islands have colonies of breeding terns and  gulls   some  of  which  are  nationally  and  regionally   important (Javed  2003). Abu  Dhabi  has  recorded  nearly  3 800  species    including  436  plants   51  mammals   427  birds   56   reptiles  and  amphibians   and  2312  invertebrates   (EAD  2017). Of  the  51  mammals  (including  terrestrial  and   marine)  species  such  as  Dugong  ( Dugong  dugon )   Indian  Ocean  Humpback  Dolphin   (Sousa  plumbea)    Arabian  Gazelle   (Gazella  arabica)    Arabian  Sand   Gazelle   (Gazella  marica)    Arabian  Tahr  ( Arabitragus  jayakari )   Arabian  Oryx   (Oryx  leucoryx)    Blanford’s  Fox   (Vulpes  cana)    and  Sind  Serotine  Bat   (Eptesicus  nasutus)   are  listed  as  threatened  by  the  IUCN.   Several  other  species  such  as  the  Rüppell’s  Fox     (Vulpes  rueppellii)    the  Sand  Cat   (Felis  margarita   thinobia)   and  Caracal   (Caracal  caracal)   have  local    conservation significance.  A  total  of  54  terrestrial  reptile  species  have  been   recorded  in  the  UAE  (Leviton   et  al.    1992   Soorae     et al.   2011; Jongbloed  2000 and Baha El Din  1986).  The only two amphibians known in the UAE are the  Arabian  Toad     (Sclerophrys  arabica)   and  the  Dhofar   Toad  (Duttaphrynus dhufarensis)   and neither of them  is listed as threatened.  Figure 1.1.1  Saunder’s Tern  one of the breeding birds on the off shore islands of Abu Dhabi. Figure 1.1.2  Green Turtle ( Chelonia mydas ) UAE  is  home  to  the  second  largest  population  of   Dugongs in the world with nearly 3 000 individuals   many  of  which  reside  in  the  waters  of  the  emirate   (EAD  2017). On land  the Arabian Oryx Protected  Area supports the largest concentration of Arabian  Oryx  in  the  UAE   with  more  than  850  individuals.    Areas such as Jabal Hafit and Al Houbara Protected   area  are  home  to  some  of  the  most  endangered   species  such  as  Arabian  Tahr   Egyptian  Vulture    (Neophron  percnopterus)   and  Asian  Houbara    (Chlamydotis macqueenii).   The emirate has made significant efforts to ensure   protection  of  these  threatened  species  and  their   habitats.  In  2017   through  an  Emiree  Decree   19   protected  areas  (13  terrestrial  &  6  marine)  were   established  covering approximately 29 % of the total  land and sea areas of the emirate (EAD  2017)  which  now stands at over 30 % following the expansion of  the  Al  Houbara  Protected  area.  The  emirate’s    Al Wathba Wetland Reserve and Bul Syayeef Marine  Protected have been designated as Ramsar sites. In  Marawah  Marine  Biosphere  Reserve  (MMBR)   the   emirate  has  the  only  such  reserve  in  the  country    which supports important habitats such as seagrasses   mangroves   coral  reefs  and  coastal  sabkhas   as  well   as a suite of distinctive species such as dugong  turtles  and  a  variety  of  shorebirds.  The  MMBR  also  is  of    significant  cultural  and  archaeological  importance   with  more  than  20  fossil  and  archeological  sites    dating back to the 16th century.  The emirate has 19 of the 30 Important Bird Areas  (IBAs) in the UAE (Evans  1994; Javed & Khan  2003;  BLI  2019). The island of Jarnein alone supports over  50 000 breeding terns every summer and is home to  breeding  colonies  of  Sooty  Gull   (Ichthyaetus  hemprichii)    White-cheeked  Tern   (Sterna  repressa)    and  Bridled  Tern   (Onychoprion  anaethetus)    some  of   which are regionally important. It is also recognised  as  a  Gift  to  the  Earth  by  WWF.  The  globally   threatened  Socotra  Cormorant   (Phalacrocorax  nigrogularis)   has  all  but  one  breeding  colony  in  the   emirate   the  only  other  being  on  Siniya  island  in   Umm Al Qaiwain. Abu Dhabi and its offshore islands  are important breeding grounds for the endangered  and  breeding  Hawksbill  Turtles   (Eretmochelys  imbricata)  while Marine Protected Areas also provide  safe  foraging  grounds  to  Green  Turtles   (Chelonia  mydas).  The southwestern waters are considered as   Ecologically and Biologically Significant Marine Areas   (EBSAs)  and  are  an  indicator  of  the  importance  of   Abu Dhabi for biodiversity locally and internationally. 1.0 Introduction  1.1 Abu Dhabi’s Biological Diversity 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species 2120   2120 The  emirate  is  fully  committed  to  safeguard  important  species  and  habitats  in    protected areas  however  designation alone does not guarantee effective protection  and management.  EAD  on behalf of the government of Abu Dhabi  undertakes systematic and regular monitoring of priority  species and their habitats. Regular monitoring aided with effective management has ensured  not only long- term population data  but also more effective management of the species. Use of satellite tracking  geolocation   remote  camera  traps   aerial  surveys  and  drones  has  ensured  that  the  data  collected  are  quick   accurate    and extensive.  Stable population of Dugongs  Hawksbill and Green Turtles  as well as many breeding terns  are direct results  of long-term monitoring and effective management. Use of cutting edge technologies have helped the emirate  in discovering many species after a gap of several years such as Caracal  Indian Crested Porcupine  (Hystrix  indica)   and Sand Cat  to name a few. Our monitoring of invertebrate fauna has led to the discovery of at least  six species new to science  as well as several species new to the UAE (Saji  et al.   2019). EAD has undertaken extensive work on the habitats  and  their  status  in  the  emirate.  The  work  of    Abu  Dhabi  Global  Environmental  Data  Initiative   (AGEDI)  through  Local   National   Regional   Biodiversity Assessment Projects stands out  under  which  habitats  and  their  protection  levels  were   mapped (AGEDI  2013). This was followed by another  extensive  habitat  mapping  project  covering   approximately 60 000 km² of land and 30 000 km² of  sea   at  a  scale  of  1 10 000   identifying  41  terrestrial   and  13  marine  habitats  (Figure  1.1.4).  This    subsequently led to the identification of 12 critical   and 8 sensitive marine and terrestrial habitat in the   emirate     published    as    Habitat    Classification   Guidelines  (Dhaheri   et  al.    2017)   and  made  widely   available to project proponents and developers. 1.0 Introduction  1.2 Current Conservation Measures  Abu Dhabi Emirate Terrestrial and Marine Habitats Road - Dual Carriageway Road - Single Carriageway Municipality Boundary Abu Dhabi Emirate Boundary International Boundary Protected Area  BASE MAP LEGEND LEGEND NOTE   Number refers to habitat code.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  2322  1.4 Need for a Local Red List Assessment  The  primary  motivation  for  initiation  of   the Abu Dhabi red list process was indeed  the  lack  of  such  a  valuable  tool   further   bolstered  by  the  fact  that  the  emirate   constitutes  more  than  80  %  of  the  total   land  area  of  the  UAE   with  a  high   proportion  of  unique  and  important   biodiversity contained within its borders. Thus  the development of local red list for Abu Dhabi  was recognised not only essential  but also critical for   two reasons. First  it would fulfil the long-standing   gap in our understanding of locally threatened species  and  our  ability  to  prioritise  conservation  actions.   Second   it  would  also  complement  the  national  red   lists have been developed for some taxa. In  addition   Abu  Dhabi  has  outlined  actions  to   protect  biodiversity  in  the  emirate  and  has  set  an   ambitious target of protecting 90 % of all habitats as  protected.  Charismatic  and  important  species  have   been used as proxy for the conservation of habitats   however   effective  conservation  planning  is  only   possible through drawing up a list of most important  and  critical  species  and  habitats  for  conservation.   This  is  also  clearly  outlined  in  the  EAD  strategy   2015-2020  where development and implementation  of  conservation  action  plans  for  key  species  and    habitats was identified as some of the performance   indicators (KPI) for measuring the success. Although  the  global  IUCN  Red  List  shows  only   around  2  %  of  all  known  species  recorded  in    Abu  Dhabi  as  threatened   this  may  be  an  under   estimation   given  that  this  status  is  determined  on   the  basis  of  the  global  distribution  of  the  species   present  in  the  emirate.  To  determine  local  status    one must assess threats to resident populations  and  consider both local and global assessments to direct  conservation effort on most threatened species. 1.0 Introudction  1.3  Challenges in Protection of Abu Dhabi  Species & Ecosystems  The  emirate  faces  many  challenges  to   protect its rich and unique biodiversity. Rapid industrial and urban development to meet the  growing  demands  for  an  ever  increasing  population   and  other  economic  developments   are  the  biggest   drivers  which  have  impacted  species  and  their   habitats.  Additionally   forces  such  as  periodic   droughts  climate change and invasive species  further   pose  significant  challenges  to  the  long-term   conservation  of  many  important  and  threatened   species and habitats.  Diverting  development   especially  in  and  around   some  unique  habitats   such  as  the  mountain  areas     of  Jabal  Hafit   much  of  the  coastline  and  some   offshore islands  still remains the biggest challenge in   Abu Dhabi. Although  the  emirate  has  invested  heavily  in   understanding  the  extent  of  habitats  by  mapping   them and setting an ambitious target to protect 90 %  of  all  habitats   the  pressure  from  development   projects remains unabated.  There is reasonably good understanding of the status  and  distribution  of  many  species  of  several  taxa    however  a Red List has been lacking  not only in the  emirate   but  also  in  the  UAE  until  recently.   Development of a local or a regional red list is not  only  fundamental  to  our  understanding  of  threat   levels faced by species  but is also a powerful tool for  conservation  planning.  The  IUCN  Species  Survival   Commission  (SSC)  frames  all  of  the  work  of  its   specialist  network  on  the  Species  Conservation   Cycle  that includes three major stages  Assessment   Planning  and  Action.  Evaluating  species  for  the  Red    List  contributes  to  the  first  stage   providing  the   necessary  data  for  prioritising  actions  and   interventions  in  species  conservation  plans.   Ultimately   the  purpose  of  this  work  is  to  improve   the  status  of  threatened  species  by  guiding  and   catalysing conservation action. 23 1.0 Introduction

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species 2726 2.0 Background to the Red Listing 2726 No national red list of species existed in  the  UAE  when  this  process  started    in 2018. There  were  however   initial  attempts  by  Hornby   (1996a) and Tourenq  et al.  (2005) for mammals  and  Hornby & Aspinall (1999) for birds  to identify impor- tant  and  threatened  species.  These  publications    however   lacked  adequate  application  of  the  IUCN   criteria or support by IUCN in general  and did not  have  the  rigorous  scrutiny  and  appeal  of  the    IUCN process. Over the past several years  and driven by the Annual  Sharjah  Biodiversity  Workshops   several  regional    Red Lists on specific taxa have been prepared (Table   2.1.1). Examples include Freshwater species (Garcia   et. al.   2008)  Carnivores (Mallon  et al.   2011)  Reptiles  (Cox  et al.   2012) and Birds of the Arabian Peninsula  (Symes  et al.   2014) undertaken at the workshop and  jointly  produced  by  IUCN   Environment  and   Protected  Areas  Authority  (EPA)   Sharjah  and   Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi.  In  2017   EAD  conducted  a  workshop  on  ‘Sharks    Rays and Chimera’s of the Arabian Sea and Adjacent  Waters’ where 174 species were assessed  of which  roughly 50 % were categorised as threatened (Jabado   et  al.    2017).

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species 2928 2.0 Background to the Red Listing 2928 The  history  of  red  lists  and  red  books    which  are  catalogs  that  summarise   information on threatened species  begun  over  50  years  ago  (Hilton-Taylor   2014).   The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species  (IUCN   2019)  is  the  primary  source  of   evidence  of  the  magnitude  of  the  global   extinction crisis. In parallel  national red lists continue to proliferate.  Only in Europe  at least 3 562 current and past red  lists are known (Köppel  et al.   2003)  while at least  108  countries   more  than  half  of  all  nations     have  produced  498  national  red  lists  on  at  least    one  taxonomic  group   56  %  of  them  since  2005    (NRLWG  2015). The  primary  uses  of  red  lists  include   1)  increase   knowledge  available  to  the  public  on  the  status  of   threatened species  2) provide a reference point to  document  change  in  the  conservation  status  of   plants   fungi  and  animals   3)  help  identify  sites    contributing significantly to the global persistence of   biodiversity  as well as sites to be included in national  protected  areas  networks   4)  monitor  human   activities  that  drive  biodiversity  loss   5)  document   progress  toward  national  commitments  established   in  convention  or  other  national  or  international   agreements   and  6)  inform  investments  of  limited   resources  on  priority  conservation  actions  (Collar    1996; Rodríguez  et al.   2004; Vié  et al.   2009; Smart    et al.   2014). In  2001   IUCN  adopted  a  series  of  standardised   extinction risk categories (see Section 3)  based on  quantitative and qualitative criteria  to classify species  on  red  lists  in  a  transparent  and  objective  way    following decades of fairly subjective risk assessments  (IUCN   2012a).  Additionally   the  current  system    clearly separates the scientific process of determining   extinction  risk   from  the  socio-environmental    process of defining conservation priorities (Rodríguez   et al.   2004; Miller  et al.   2006  2007).  It  is  not  always  feasible  to  assign  the  same    category  that  a  species  has  globally  to  its  regional   sub-populations  such as the ones located in a group  of  countries   a  particular  nation   or  one  of  its   provinces.  To  perform  evaluations  at  these  sub- global levels  one must consider additional factors  as  the distribution of species generally do not coincide  with  geopolitical  borders   there  is  sometimes   migration  of  non-reproductive  individuals  between   neighbouring populations  or populations in a region  are  non-native.  For  these  cases   IUCN  (2012b)   developed  a  set  of  Guidelines  for  Application  of   IUCN  Red  List  Criteria  at  Regional  and  National   Levels  that follow a three-step process. First  one must clearly identify the regional population  to be evaluated. For example  it may be a population   defined by a political boundary  such as a country or   a  state.  It  could  also  be  a  watershed   or  if  it  is  an   aquatic animal  a stretch of a river. In any case  what   is important is that the delimitation is clearly defined.  The  second  step  is  to  apply  the  IUCN  Red  List   Categories  and  Criteria  (IUCN   2012a)  to  the   regional population  as if it was the global population  of the species  to determine the preliminary estimate  of extinction risk within the region. The reason why   this risk estimate is not definitive  is because regional   populations  are  typically  a  fraction  of  the  global   population   and  regularly  exchange  individuals  with   other sub-populations. Therefore  it is possible that  the  extinction  risk  of  the  regional  population  is    influenced by what occurs elsewhere. If the regional   population frequently receives migrants from other  sub-populations  of  the  same  species   its  extinction   risk would be lower to the preliminary estimate  as   if it were to go extinct  it would be easily recolonised.  If   in  contrast   the  regional  population  is  a  net   exporter  of  individuals  to  the  global  population    extinction  risk  could  be  higher  than  indicated  by   application of the global criteria.  The  final  step  is   therefore   adjustment  of  the  category  in the first example (when extinction risk   of  the  regional  population  is  lower)  the  guidelines   recommend down-listing by one (or more) categories  the  initial  estimate  of  extinction  risk   while  in  the   second example (when extinction risk of the regional  population  is  higher)  up-listing  is  recommended.  In   all cases  however  the assessors must clearly justify  the adjustment (IUCN  2012b). In February  2018  EAD  Provita and IUCN   organised a five-day workshop with three   objectives  1)    To  train  EAD  experts  in  the  IUCN  Red  Listing   process  especially assessments at the local level    2)    Familiarise  staff  with  other  IUCN  knowledge   products such as the Red List of Ecosystems and  Key Biodiversity Areas  and;  3)   Plan the following steps  leading to the publication   of the first Abu Dhabi Red List of Species  and   initiation  of  ecosystem  red  list  assessments  in    the emirate.  The first two days focused on the IUCN Red List of   Threatened  Species   the  assessment  process   the   criteria   applications  at  the  regional  and  national   level  examples and case studies. Days three and four  were structured similarly  but on the IUCN Red List   of Ecosystems  while the final day was devoted to   presenting  results  and  discussing  integration  of   species and ecosystem assessments. A brief session  also  introduced  Key  Biodiversity  Areas  and  their   connection to red lists.  The next step of the process was for the EAD team  to perform species assessments and share them with  the team of trainers for review and feedback. A work  plan  that  covered  the  rest  of  2018  and  early  2019    established  the  number  of  assessments  to  be   produced  each  month   and  the  maximum  intervals   for sending comments back to the assessors. Regular  email exchanges were also undertaken  to assist with  questions  or  challenges.  The  ultimate  goal  of  this   exercise  was  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  EAD   specialists  in  performing  biodiversity  status   assessments to inform public policies on conservation  and sustainable use. The lesson learned in Abu Dhabi  will  also  help  streamline  the  fairly  uncommon   practice  within  IUCN  of  simultaneous  training  in   more than one knowledge product at a time  allowing   for  lower  costs  and  higher  efficiency  of  national   biodiversity assessments.  2.2 The Red Listing Process 2.3 Initial Training and Planning Workshop  Figure 2.2.1  Experts participation at the species assessment workshop organised by EAD  Provita and IUCN. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species 3130 2.0 Background to the Red Listing 3130 Following the workshop  species assessments were led by the EAD team  with support  from  the  Provita  team  in  Caracas.  During  the  workshop   case  studies  allowed  to   outline  the  assessment  process  and  illustrate  the  application  of  the  IUCN  Red  List   Categories and Criteria (IUCN  2012) and the regional guidelines (IUCN  2012b).  Many species were initially identified as potentially either Least Concern (LC) or Data Deficient (DD).   Completing  the  assessment  documentation  for  these  species  is  often  much  less  intensive  and  prioritising   completion of these assessments can ensure timely progress with the overall process. As  discussed  below  (Section  3)   the  Red  List  criteria  measures  quantitative  thresholds  of  extinction  risk   based on reduction in population size  restricted area or small/restricted population size. For many species   only basic information and knowledge is needed to identify them as likely being LC or DD using the guiding   flow chart below. Species  identified  as  ‘likely  Least  Concern’  were  assessed first. Those species identified as ‘likely Data  Deficient’ were considered next  before finally moving   on  to  those  species  that  are  likely  to  meet  criteria   thresholds and will require more rigorous attention.  The species accounts included in this publication are   those  for  the  species  classified  as  threatened   (Critically  Endangered   Endangered  and  Vulnerable- Appendix 1)  however a list of all species assessed is  included for reference in Appendix 2. The  EAD  team  compiled  all  information  necessary   to complete species accounts  including distribution  maps   and  calculation  of  Extent  of  Occurrence   (EOO)  and  Area  of  Occupancy  (AOO).  Draft   assessments  were  sent  to  the  Provita  team  to    provide feedback and confirm the designation of Red   List  categories  according  to  the  data  available.   External  revision  of  species  accounts  was  also   requested  from  an  experienced  consultant.  EOO   and  AOO  calculations  were  made  following  the   standard procedure indicated by IUCN (2017). Distribution maps were generated by georeferencing  all known locations for each species. Based on these  points   the  minimum  convex  polygon  was  created.   This  polygon  was  adjusted  and  clipped  with  map    of  habitats  (EAD   2015)  and  altitude  intervals  that    the  species  inhabits  producing  the  respective   distribution maps.  *   In answering this question assessors do not need to measure actual values against criteria thresholds but use  broader  and immediately available species information and expert knowledge.  2.4 Assessment Method and Process  Likely Least Concern Likely Data Deficient  Potentially Threatened Yes / likely Yes   No No / Not likely Is the species broad ranging and  is its population size stable (ie  no threats causing reduction)?* Is the species only known from  its type specimen(s) or very  limited numbers (usually less  than ten records)   Figure 2.4.1 Arabian tahr ( Arabitragus jayakari )

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species 3736  3.0 IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria 3736 A  key  and  unique  feature  of  the  Red  List  is  the   assessment  of  the  species  extinction  risk   and  its    classification  in  one  of  the  Red  List  categories.   Determination  of  extinction  risk  is  achieved  by    examining  a  series  of  symptoms   divided  into  five   sets  of  criteria.  Detailed  guidance  and  information   on how to apply the IUCN Red List Categories and  Criteria can be found in several publications  including  IUCN  (2012a)  and  IUCN  Standards  and  Petitions   Subcommittee  (2017)   but  a  few  basic  ideas  will  be   outlined below.  The  five  criteria   A-E   each  focus  on  a  particular   measure  of  the  size  of  the  population  or  its   geographical  distribution   and  their  changes  over   time.  They  rely  on  observations  of  the  past  and   inferences  of  the  future   and  on  a  wide  variety  of   data  sources  to  document  trends.  Assessors  are    encouraged to apply the five criteria  although the   status  of  a  species  can  be  determined  by  only  one.   Initially   to  new  assessors   it  often  feels  like  the   knowledge required to apply the criteria will only be  available for a handful of species. But practice tends  to teach that the diversity of indicators that can be   applied  more  often  than  not  allow  well-justified   listing for almost any species.  Species listed under Criterion A  are included due to  reduction of population size. Risk is a measure of the   likelihood  an  an  undesired  event  over  a  defined   period of time. So the shorter the period over which  the  population  decline  happens   or  the  higher  the   magnitude of the decline  higher will be the risk. Criterion  B  is  about  declines  in  geographical   distribution. There is more than one way to measure  decline in range  but if species have a small range  and  it  is  fragmented   or  it  experiences  continuous    declines  or  extreme  fluctuations   species  may  be   listed according to this criterion. Extinction risk increases as populations get smaller    so Criteria C and D reflect this. If populations are   small  and  are  undergoing  continuous  declines     fragmentation or extreme fluctuations  they may be  classified under Criterion C. If the breeding popu-  lation  is  extremely  small   then  Criterion  D  comes   into play.  The final criterion  Criterion E  is rarely used to list   species  but it is probably the most important one of  all.  As  mentioned  above   Red  List  categories  are   statements of risk  which is exactly what Criterion E  is.  For  example   under  Criterion  E   a  species  is   endangered  if  “the  probability  of  extinction  in  the    wild is at least 20 % within 20 years or five generations    whichever is the longer.” This criterion provides an   anchor for all the rest  and explicitly defines what   threatened species are. Species  plants   animals   fungi  and  algae  may  be    classified into eleven categories (see figure 3.2). The  first three are fairly obvious and refer to species that   have  already  disappeared.  Extinct  (EX)  are  those   there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual  has died  Extinct in the Wild (EW) means that it has  gone  extinct  in  its  natural  habitat  and  only  exists   under human care ( e.g.  botanical gardens or zoos) or  in  a  region  that  does  not  correspond  to  its  native   range  while Regionally Extinct (RE) means that the  last  individual  potentially  capable  of  reproduction   within the region has died or has disappeared from  the  wild  in  the  region   or  when   if  it  is  a  former   visiting  taxon   the  last  individual  has  died  or   disappeared in the wild from the region.  Despite its name  the IUCN Red List  of Threatened Species is not really a  list  nor it is only about threatened  species. It is a comprehensive database  of information on plants  fungi and  animals of the world. A typical species  account summarises knowledge on   its classification  population trend    geographic distribution  habitat  threats   conservation actions  use and trade.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species 38  The  next  three  categories    Critically  Endangered   (CR)     Endangered   (EN)  and   Vulnerable   (VU)   are   assigned on the basis of quantitative and qualitative   criteria that reflect different levels of extinction risk    and  jointly  are  referred  to  as  ‘threatened’  species   categories. In simple terms  what this means is that  species  considered  CR  face  a  very  high  immediate    extinction risk  those classified EN face a high risk in   the  nearby  future   while  for  VU  species  risk  is  also   high  but in the medium term.   Near  Threatened   (NT)  applies  to  cases  that  do    not  qualify  for  threatened  at  present   but  are  very   close  to  the  thresholds  and  may  meet  them  in  the   near future.  Least Concern  (LC) should be assigned  to  species  that  do  not  qualify  (nor  are  close    to  qualify)  as  threatened  or  NT.  LC  includes  all   species not facing an immediate threat and those that  may  be  described  as  out  of  danger   however     IUCN recommends referring to them as LC  because  all species face some level of extinction risk even if it  is minimal or long-term. The  category   Data  Deficient   (DD)  is  given  to   species  when  there  is  inadequate  information  to   make  a  reliable  assessment  of  its  extinction  risk.   Prior  to  using  this  category  it  is  recommended  to   examine  all  possible  sources  of  information  and   analyse all available data. This to avoid classifying as  DD  species  that  are  indeed  threatened  or  extinct    thus  potentially  ignoring  them  when  establishing   conservation  priorities.   Not  Applicable   (NA)  is   used in national red lists to identify species that are  not part of a stable wild population or are not in part  of  their  natural  range  within  the  region  of  study.   Finally     Not  Evaluated   (NE)  refers  to  species  that   have yet not been contrasted with the thresholds of  the  categories  and  criteria  for  IUCN  red  lists.  The    categories  DD   LC   NA  and  NE  do  not  reflect   extinction risk.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  43 A total of 74 species were categorised as threatened in the assessment of over 244  species in Abu Dhabi Emirate.  Our  assessment  showed  that  among  terrestrial  mammals  species  such  as  Blandford’s  Fox   (Vulpes  cana)    Arabian Tahr  (Arabitragus jayakari)   Gordon’s Wild Cat  (Felis lybica gordoni)  are Critically Endangered. Although  none of the marine mammal species is critically endangered  species such as Finless Porpoise  (Neophocaena  phocaenoides)  and Hawksbill Turtle  (Eretmochelys imbricata)  are endangered along with terrestrial species such  as Sand Cat  (Felis margarita thinobia)  and Rüppell’s Fox  (Vulpes rueppellii) . Species which are Vulnerable are the  Arabian  Oryx   (Oryx  leucoryx)    the  Arabian  Sand  Gazelle   (Gazella  marica)   and  the  Arabian  Gazelle   (Gazella  arabica)  along with the Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin  (Sousa plumbea)  and the Dugong  (Dugong dugon) .  Among  birds   of  the  33  threatened  species   10  are   Critically  Endangered   10  Endangered  and  13   Vulnerable. Critically Endangered bird species include  the resident Egyptian Vulture  (Neophron percnopterus)    the Pharaoh Eagle-Owl  (Bubo ascalaphus)  the Greater  Spotted  Eagle   (Aquila  clanga)   and  the  Sooty  Falcon   (Falcon  concolor) .  Key  endangered  species  include   Osprey    (Pandion  haliaetus)    the  Socotra  Cormorant    (Phalacrocorax nigrogularis)  and the Redbilled Tropicbird   (Phaethon  aethereus)    whereas  species  such  as  Crab   Plover  (Dromas  ardeola)   and  Sand  Partridge   (Ammoperdix heyi)  are listed as Vulnerable (Figure 4.1.1) Among  plants  species  such  as  Oriental  Cherry    (Acridocarpus  orientalis)    Maiden  Hairfern   (Adiantum   capillus-veneris)  and Dwarf Palm  (Nannorrhops ritchieana)   are  Critically  Endangered  where  as   Vachellia  flava     Vachellia tortilis   White Saxaul    (Haloxylon persicum)  and   Prosopis cineraria  are listed as Endangered. Among  reptiles   Wonder  gecko   (Teratoscincus  keyserlingii)    is  listed  as  Critically  Endangered   while   spiny-tailed lizard  (Uromastyx aegyptia)  is categorised  as Vulnerable. Of the four threatened invertebrates   Yellow  Desert  Scorpion   (Vachoniolus  globimanus)   is   listed  as  Critically  Endangered  and  Camel  Spider   ( Galeodes arabs ) is listed as Endangered.

Although  some  species  such  as  Arabian  Leopard   have  become  Regionally  Extinct   historical  records   showed  the  country  has  nevertheless  been  an   important  mammal  biodiversity  hotspot.  A  wide   range of suitable habitats still support both large and  small mammals while on-going research continues to   discover and redefine current occurrence range and   population densities.  Within the Abu Dhabi Emirate  41 species (including  non-native)  of  terrestrial  mammal  have  been   recorded. This group comprises 18 families with the  highest number of 9 species in Muridae followed by 5  species  each  in  Bovidae   Canidae  and  Felidae.   Increased  survey  efforts  have  recently  rediscovered   elusive species in the Abu Dhabi Emirate with records  of Indian Crested Porcupine ( Hystrix indica )  Sand Cat  ( Felis  margarita  thinobia )   Arabian  Caracal  ( Caracal  caracal schmitzi ) and Rüppell’s Fox ( Vulpes rueppellii )    which have been identified in various locations.  Although  feral  species  can  be  found  in  almost  all   habitats  within  the  emirate   they  have  not  been   included in the Abu Dhabi Red List. As these species  are  not  endemic  to  the  region   hybridisation  can   occur between distinct breeds (such as those seen in  felines and canids). Therefore  it cannot be assumed  that they represent true species and thus have been  deemed  Not  Listed.  Of  the  assessed  species   3  are   Critically Endangered (CR)  3 as Vulnerable (VU) and  2  as  Endangered  (EN).  The  remaining  species  were   assessed  as  either  Least  Concern  (LC)  or  Data    Deficient (DD).  Currently   Gordon’s  Wildcat  ( Felis  lybica  gordoni )   Blanfords  Fox  ( Vulpes  cana )  and  Arabian  Tahr   ( Arabitragus  jayakari )  were  assessed  as  CR  and  they   are  most  often  associated  with  mountain  habitats.   Whereas Arabian Gazelle ( Gazella arabica )  Arabian  Sand  Gazelle  ( Gazella  marica )  and  Arabian  Oryx   ( Oryx leucoryx ) are primarily desert species and they  are  all  assessed  as  VU.  Both  Rüppell’s  Fox  ( Vulpes  rueppellii )  and  Sand  Cat  ( Felis  margarita )  are  highly   elusive desert species and they are more sensitive to  direct  threats  because  they  require  high  quality   habitat.  However   their  large  range  of  occurrence   provides  some  protection  and  they  are  considered   to be Endangered (EN). The  on-going  protection  and  monitoring  of  these   species is a primary focus for EAD. The allocation of  designated  protected  areas  across  the  emirate  and   their  planned  expansion  in  the  future   provides   valuable  refuge  and  foraging  ground  for  all   environmentally sensitive mammal species within the  emirate. The re-introduction of the Arabian Oryx is a  success story of EAD’s conservation programme  as is  the continued rediscovery of highly elusive species as  a result of on-going monitoring programmes. 4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  4746  Arabian Gazelle   (Gazella arabica)  Rationale  -------  Gazella arabica  has an area of occupancy (AOO) less  than  200 km2  and  an  extent  of  occurrence  (EOO)   less than 20 000 km2  which added to the degradation  of its habitat and the fragmentation of the population   the category of Vulnerable (VU) is assigned.  Distribution  ------- In  Abu  Dhabi  this  species  has  been  recorded  in   areas  around  Ghantoot   Sweihan   Al  Ain   Madinat   Zayed  Al Mirfa and Al Houbara Protected area.   Population  ------- Very few wild individuals exist within the Abu Dhabi  Emirate with the majority present considered likely  to  be  escapees  from  private  collections.  A  recent    aerial survey identified 10 free roaming gazelle in    the  Al  Dhafra  region.  Although  a  survey  was  not   conducted  in  the  eastern  region  it  is  estimated    that  similar  number  exist  there.  Therefore   it  is   considered  that  there  are  <  50  individuals  in   Abu Dhabi Emirate.  It should be emphasised that this figure applies only   to  animals  considered  fully  ‘wild’  under  the  IUCN   Red  List  Guidelines.

Alzaabi  R. Gazelles  are  kept  in  many  private  collections    and  breeding  centres   especially  in  the  UAE.  In   Abu Dhabi  several thousands are under some form  of management.   Population Trend  ------- Population is decreasing.  Threats  ------- The main threats to this species are  in parts of the  range   habitat  degradation  due  to  overgrazing  and   population fragmentation. Reduced viable habitat is  also a threat. Within captive populations inbreeding  is likely occurring and genetic weakness may result.  Given the high density of animals within enclosures   disease may cause loss of overall numbers.   Conservation Actions Underway  ------- Population  management  is  occurring  within   protected  areas  although  a  dedicated  management    plan  for  the  species  has  yet  to  be  finalised.  This   species is protected under Federal Law 24 of 1999  and Local Law 22 of 2005 which prohibits hunting of  this species. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  4948  Arabian Sand Gazelle   (Gazella marica)  Rationale  -------  Gazella  marica   has  a  decreasing  population  trend.    A recent aerial survey over the emirate counted less  than  500  individuals  distributed  widely   but  in  a   single  sub-population   and  a  continuous  decline  is   inferred.  Therefore  this  species  is  categorised  as   Vulnerable (VU).  Distribution  ------- This species is widely distributed from the Arabian  Peninsula with historical distribution being through- out  the  sand  deserts   limestone  plateau  and    gravel  plains  of  the  Arabian  Peninsula.  Within  Abu  Dhabi  this  species  has  been  recorded  across   the emirate.  Population  ------- There  are  no  estimates  of  former  population  size    but numbers are considered to be greatly reduced  and the range of the species has declined markedly.   A  recent  aerial  survey  in  2018  in  the  Abu  Dhabi   Emirate recorded less than 500 individuals. Previous  survey  records  had  questionable  results  and    were  deemed  to  be  inaccurate  and  omitted  from    present data.

Alzaabi  R.  It should be emphasised that this figure applies only   to  animals  considered  fully  ‘wild’  under  the  IUCN   Red List Guidelines. Large numbers of Arabian Sand  Gazelles  are  kept  in  many  private  collections  and   breeding centres  especially in UAE. In Abu Dhabi   several  tens  of  thousands  are  under  some  form  of   management  especially in private collections.  Population Trend  ------- Population is decreasing.  Threats  ------- The  main  threats  to  this  species  in  parts  of  the   range   is  habitat  degradation  due  to  overgrazing.   Reduced  viable  habitat  is  also  a  threat.  Within   captive populations inbreeding is likely occurring   Conservation Actions Underway  ------- Population  management  is  occurring  within   protected  areas  although  a  dedicated  management    plan  for  the  species  has  yet  to  be  finalised.  This   species is protected under Federal Law 24 of 1999  and Local Law 22 of 2005 which prohibits hunting of  this species. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  5150  Arabian Oryx    (Oryx leucoryx)  Rationale  -------  Oryx  leucoryx   has  a  current  population  of  less  than   1 000 mature individuals. Its distribution is restricted  to  few  geographical  locations  albeit  protected  and   managed to a small extent. Despite threats to this   species being significantly reduced it is categorised   as Vulnerable (VU).  Distribution  ------- Within the Abu Dhabi Emirate this species has been  reintroduced to the Arabian Oryx Protected Area  in  the  Al  Dhafra  region  and  represents  the  largest   population of free roaming Oryx in the emirate.  Population  ------- Reintroduction  and  breeding  programmes  have   increased  the  population  of  Arabian  Oryx  within   the  emirate  to  <  1 000  in  the  protected  areas   (Environment  Agency  -  Abu  Dhabi  2010).  Although   the  population  numbers  are  high  within  this   protected  area   access  is  strictly  controlled  and   therefore reports from the general public are rare.  On-going monitoring programmes occur in order to  determine  breeding  success  of  the  population.   Similarly  the populations present within the Arabian  Oryx Protected Area are supplemented with water  and feed at designated feed stations.  VU  Distribution Map Arabian Oryx  (Oryx leucoryx)  Local Red List Assessment Category   Vulnerable D1  Global Red List Assessment   2018 Vulnerable (VU)   Assessors   Gubiani  R.  Alzaabi  R.  Population Trend  ------- Population trend is stable.  Threats  ------- The  main  threats  to  this  species  are  loss  of    habitat  from  development  projects  and  droughts.    Additional  pressure  for  food  resources  from   livestock as well as the distribution of disease from  domestic ungulates could also pose a threat to the  current population.  Conservation Actions Underway  ------- This  species  is  protected  under  Federal  Law  24  of   1999  and  Local  Law  22  of  2005  which  prohibits   hunting of this species. Almost all released animals  occur in protected areas. The captive population is  well-managed   with  an  international  studbook.  A   regional  Arabian  Oryx  conservation  strategy  was   developed  in  2007.  The  Coordinating  Committee   for the Conservation of the Arabian Oryx (CCCAO)   an  inter-governmental  body  charged  with  co- ordination  of  conservation  efforts  within  the   Arabian Peninsula. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  5352  Arabian Tahr    (Arabitragus jayakari)  Rationale  ------- The  Arabian  Tahr  has  a  very  small  geographic   occurrence  with  less  than  100  km2  of  extent    restricted  to  a  single  location  affected  by  habitat   loss  and  reduction  of  its  quality   combined  with  a   very small population in a continuing decline. All of  these  deems  this  species  to  be  categorised  as   Critically Endangered (CR).  Distribution  ------- The entire world population of Arabian Tahr occurs  in the mountains of northern Oman and the United  Arab Emirates  where it prefers north facing slopes  between 1 000 and 1 800 m  which are characterised  by  relatively  high  rainfall   cooler  temperatures  and   diverse vegetation. The small population that occurs  in  the  Abu  Dhabi  Emirate  is  only  present  on   Jabal Hafit.  Population  ------- There  is  no  recent  estimate  of  total  population    though there are probably fewer than 5 000 animals  globally.  Although  some  populations  may  have   increased through protection  overall it is likely that  the species continues to decline.   Definitive  numbers  for  the  Jabal  Hafit  population   have  not  been  established  at  this  point  in  time.   However visual assessments indicate that no more   Distribution Map  Arabian Tahr  (Arabitragus jayakari)  Local Red List Assessment Category   Critically Endangered B1ab(iii); D  Global Red List Assessment   2018 Endangered (EN)   Assessors   Gubiani  R.  Alzaabi  R. CR than 15 individuals occur. No record of immigration  or emigration of individuals into nearby populations  have been recorded recently or historically indicating  a stand-alone satellite population.   Population Trend  ------- Population trend is unknown.  Threats  ------- The greatest threat to the survival of the species is  loss of habitat. Continued development on or in the   surrounding area of Jabal Hafit has reduced available   foraging  area  for  the  species   which  is  important   during  extended  periods  of  drought.  Competition   with  livestock   primarily  domestic  goats  further   reduced the availability of food and there is evidence  that  they  are  susceptible  to  diseases  that  affect   domestic goats. The recent escape of Nubian Ibex  ( Capra nubiana ) and Esfahan mouflon ( Ovis orientalis  isphahanica ) on Jabal Hafit will also increase resource   competition and could possibly lead to hybridisation  between these species and Arabian Tahr.   Conservation Actions Underway  ------- Currently a satellite-tracking programme is planned  which  aims  to  determine  feeding   breeding  and    home range ecology for the Jabal Hafit population.   The  additional  data  obtained  will  lead  to  a    more  rigorous  management  programme  to  be    implemented as well as the first known population   assessment  in  the  Abu  Dhabi  Emirate.  Hunting  of   the species is illegal under Federal Law 24 of 1999. Should  wild  populations  unexpectedly  crash   small   viable  populations  are  currently  present  within    private collections and are likely sufficient enough to   restock  wild  populations  should  the  need  be   warranted. This species is protected under Federal  Law  24  of  1999  and  Local  Law  22  of  2005  which   prohibits hunting of this species. 
 The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  5554  Blanford’s Fox    (Vulpes cana)  Rationale  -------  Vulpes  cana   has  a  small  extent  of  occurrence  and   area  of  occupancy   less  than  30  km²   and  it  is   distributed in a single location threatened by habitat  loss  and  competition  with  invasive  species.  This   species  has  an  inferred  population  of  less  than    50  individuals.  For  this  situation  the  species  is   categorised as Critically Endangered (CR).  Distribution  ------- Recent camera trap investigations re-discovered the   presence of this species on Jabal Hafit in Al Ain in   2018 and 2019.   Population  ------- Little  population  information  is  known  for  this   species  generally  and  none  is  available  for  the  Abu  Dhabi  Emirate.  Only  recently  have  records    occurred for this species on Jabal Hafit. Population   density has yet to be determined.   Population Trend  ------- Population trend is unknown.  Distribution Map  Blanford’s Fox  (Vulpes cana)  Local Red List Assessment Category   Critically Endangered B1ab(iii); D  Global Red List Assessment   2018 Least Concern (LC)   Assessors   Gubiani  R.  Alzaabi  R. CR  Threats  ------- There  are  currently  no  obvious  major  threats   resulting  in  range-wide  declines  of  Blanford’s  Fox.   However   general  habitat  loss   due  mainly  to   expanding  settlement  and  tourism  development    and  human  persecution  and  indirect  mortality   do   pose  localised  threats.  Loss  of  viable  habitat  along   coastal areas with mountainous ecosystems may be   of  significant  threat  to  populations  present  in    the  northern  emirates.  In  Abu  Dhabi  Emirate    competition  with  invasive  species  for  limited   resources  is  likely  affecting  the  population  present    on Jabal Hafit. Similarly  development on Jabal Hafit   has also reduced viable habitat for this species.   Conservation Actions Underway  -------  Currently no specific conservation programmes are   in  place.  This  species  is  protected  under  Federal   Law  24  of  1999  and  Local  Law  22  of  2005  which   prohibits hunting of this species. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  5756  Rüppell’s Fox    (Vulpes rueppellii)  Rationale  -------  Vulpes  rueppellii   has  an  elusive  nature  but  recent   information collected indicated that up < 100 mature  individuals  exist  within  Abu  Dhabi  Emirate.   Additionally  the continued loss of habitat quality is  one  of  the  principal  threats.  For  those  reason  this   species is categorised as Endangered (EN).   Distribution  -------  In Arabia this species is generally confined to the   arid  steppe  and  desert  regions  of  the  Peninsula.   Populations  in  Abu  Dhabi  have  occurred  almost   exclusively  in  arid  desert  environments  with    confirmed historical records occurring in the empty   quarter as far back as 1992. Recent survey records   confirm their presence in the Al Dhafra region with   both  juvenile  and  adult  individuals  recorded    indicating  an  active  breeding  population.  Given  the   lack of resources within these areas it is highly likely  that  average  home  range  for  this  species  could  be    quite significant and true distribution is difficult to   determine given its highly elusive nature.   Population  ------- Recent  emirate  wide  population  surveys  have   occurred and provide some indication of population  density.  The  habitat  quality  within  these  survey   locations  is  considered  be  reasonable  although   grazing pressure has reduced overall habitat quality   Distribution Map  Rüppells Fox  (Vulpes rueppellii)  Local Red List Assessment Category   Endangered D  Global Red List Assessment   2018 Least Concern (LC)   Assessors   Gubiani  R.  Alzaabi  R. EN ultimately  reducing  carrying  capacity.  Overall   population statistics are currently not available but  given  the  likely  home  range  requirements  it  is   estimated  that  up  <  50  breeding  pairs  exist  within   Abu Dhabi Emirate.   Population Trend  ------- Population trend is unknown.  Threats  ------- Major  threats  to  this  species  include  development   on  important  habitat  areas  outside  of  protected   zones. Agricultural and oil and gas development also  continues  to  remove  important  Rüppell’s  Fox    habitat. More concerning is the continued overgraz- ing of desert environments by large populations of  privately  owned  camels.  The  overgrazing  greatly    reduces  the  suitable  habitat  for  Rüppell’s  Fox  prey    items  and  increases  desertification  levels.  The    already  limited  resource  base  for  this  fox  species   will  increase  pressure  on  the  overall  population  as   carrying capacity of the habitats are greatly reduced.   Conservation Actions Underway  ------- This  species  is  protected  under  Federal  Law  24  of   1999  and  Local  Law  22  of  2005  which  prohibits    hunting  of  this  species.  Currently  no  specific   conservation  programmes  are  in  place   however   further monitoring of the species is planned. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  5958  Sand Cat    (Felis margarita thinobia)  Rationale  -------  Felis margarita  has an elusive nature  but the recent  addition of camera trap information allowed a more  robust decision to be made. This species has a small  population  with  less  than  150  mature  individuals   estimated  to  exist  within  Abu  Dhabi  Emirate.  The   Principal threats are the effects of hybridisation with  domestic cat species that has likely occurred and is  evidenced  by  the  presence  of  known  pathogens   transferral between feral and this native cat species.  For  those  reasons  this  species  is  categorised  as   Endangered (EN).   Distribution  ------- The Arabian Sand Cat was initially recorded in the  Arabian  Peninsula  in  1950   however  due  to  the   elusive nature of this species historical records are  scarce.  Of  the  records  obtained  within  the  UAE    sightings have occurred in Al Ain  Al Dhafra region   Sweihan   Al  Houbara  Protected  area   Liwa   Barqa    Al  Soqour  Protected  area   Bida’  Hazaa’  Protected   area   Al  Ghada  Protected  area  and  the  borders  of   the UAE near Oman and Saudi Arabia.  Population  ------- Recent  emirate  wide  population  surveys  have    not  occurred  although  localised  surveys  provide   some  indication  of  population  density.  The  habitat     Distribution Map  Sand Cat  (Felis margarita)  Local Red List Assessment Category   Endangered D  Global Red List Assessment   2018 Least Concern (LC)   Assessors   Gubiani  R.  Alzaabi  R. EN quality  within  these  survey  locations  is  considered   high  given  the  long  term  protection  and  reduced   grazing pressure from livestock. Similarly  militarised  areas  inadvertently  provide  protected  status   allowing no grazing to occur and habitat preservation  to continue. Limited research and the shy behaviour   of this species has made it very difficult to obtain  accurate  population  figures.  Recent  surveys  in    Al  Houbara  Protected  area  recorded  at  least    20  different  individuals  while  a  separate  small    scale  survey  recorded  2  individuals  in  Al  Ghada   Protected  area  in  2017.  The  coverage  of  these    areas  and  the  distribution  of  known  individuals    provides  an  estimate  of    150  individuals  within    Abu Dhabi Emirate.   Population Trend  ------- Population trend is unknown  likely decreasing.  Threats  ------- Major threats to this species include the development  on  important  habitat  areas  outside  of  protected   zones. Similarly  the introduction of domestic cats is  leading  to  hybridisation  with  the  Arabian  Sandcat   with some populations harbouring domestic diseases  such as Toxoplasmosis. This hybridisation in addition  to continued hunting and persecution further reduces  the rigidity of the population genetics for this species.  The continued increase in feral cat populations also   results  in  significant  competition  between  already   limited  food  sources  and  pressure  on  den  sites   needed for reproduction. Agricultural and oil and gas  development  also  continues  to  remove  important   Sand Cat habitat.  Conservation Actions Underway  ------- The  establishment  of  protected  areas  has  likely   allowed  some  reduction  in  population  loss  for  this   species. Similarly  additional survey programmes and  genetics  studies  are  providing  valuable  information   regarding  the  biology   ecology  and  population   structure  of  this  species  within  the  Abu  Dhabi   Emirate.  Protected  areas  have  been  established.   Furthermore   a  dedicated  breeding  programme  at   Al  Ain  Zoo  aims  to  breed  enough  individuals  to   release into the wild  supplementing restricted gene  pools  or  re-populating  areas  that  have  recently   gained protected status.  This  species  is  protected  under  Federal  Law  24  of   1999  and  Local  Law  22  of  2005  which  prohibits   hunting of this species. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  6160  Gordon’s Wildcat  (Felis lybica gordoni)  Rationale  -------  Felis lybica gordoni  has a very small EOO and AOO  and  is  present  in  a  single  location.  Loss  of  habitat    hybridisation  with  domestic  cats  and  competition   with feral cat population  are some of the principal  threats. Additionally a very small population of <10   mature individuals allow this species to be classified   as Critically Endangered (CR).   Distribution  ------- This  distinct  sub-species  is  known  to  occur  within   the  UAE  and  Oman  although  distribution  may  be   greater  and  genetic  testing  of  type  specimens  or   individuals  in  regional  collections  are  warranted.    Important site for this taxon are within Jabal Hafit   and the surrounding area of Al Ain.  Population  ------- Breeding  populations  for  this  species  is  currently   unknown with additional information needed to aid  in  determining  overall  species  density  within  the    emirate.  All  records  have  occurred  at  Jabal  Hafit   indicating  the  presence  of  a  small  population  likely   to be < 10 individuals. This species is considered to  be  rare  in  the  emirate  although  populations  are   known to occur in more mountainous areas within  the  UAE.  It  is  not  known  whether  movement   between  the  different  populations  within  the   country do occur.

Alzaabi R. CR  Population Trend  ------- Population trend is unknown  likely decreasing.  Threats  ------- Major  threats  to  this  species  include  the     development on Jabal Hafit and rapid development   in  the  surrounding  foothills.  Similarly   the  intro- duction of domestic cats is leading to hybridisation  with Gordon’s Wildcat  further reducing the rigidity  of  the  population  genetics  for  this  area.  The   continued  increase  in  feral  cat  populations  also    results in significant competition between already   limited  food  sources  and  pressure  on  den  sites   needed for reproduction. Agricultural development  also  continues  to  remove  important  Gordon’s   Wildcat habitat resulting in this species considered  to be one of the most threatened in Arabia.   Conservation Actions Underway  ------- This  species  is  protected  under  Federal  Law  24  of   1999  and  Local  Law  22  of  2005  which  prohibits   hunting of this species.

Green turtles  humpback dolphins  sea snakes  dugongs and almost 500 species of fish are all   found  in  the  waters  of  the  southern  Gulf  and  the  east  coast  of  Oman  Gulf  which  laps  at   Fujairah’s rocky shore. In Abu Dhabi  we monitor nine species of marine mammals and reptiles that includes dugongs  sea snakes   marine turtles and dolphins alongside their habitats.  Of the nine marine species assessed  two species were evaluated as Endangered (EN)  two species were   Vulnerable  one species was Least Concern (LC) and four species were Data Deficient(DD).  Federally   both  laws  number  (23)  and  (24)  of  1999  protect  and  conserve  marine  species  as  well  as  their   habitats. In order to conserve and protect these species  a number of actions have been taken and others are  underway. Protected areas have been established on the basis of the results found through annual monitoring  and surveys. Protected areas not only prohibit activities but also enforce speed limits for vessels in the areas  where these species occur in high density. The country is also signatory to certain international conventions  that aid in implementing conservation actions. Long-term monitoring for all species is in place with annual  revision to enhance and broaden data collected.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  6564  Dugong   (Dugong dugon)  Rationale  -------  Dugong  dugon   are  found  occupying  the  seagrass   areas  of  Abu  Dhabi.  Aerial  surveys  estimate  a   population  of  3 000  in  Abu  Dhabi.  The  population   appears  to  have  remained  stable  over  the  past  18   years.  This  species  almost  exclusively  occupies   seagrass  areas  which  translates  to  an  estimated   AOO of 1 500 km². Seagrass throughout Abu Dhabi  is continually declining in extent and quality due to  coastal dredging and reclamation. Given the current  range  of  impact  from  such  threatening  events    locations are estimated to be less than 10. By-catch   and entanglement also pose a significant threat to   this species. Various conservations measures are in  place for this species  however  habitat loss continues  to  be  the  major  threat  to  this  species  moving   forward. It is therefore assessed as Vulnerable (VU).  Distribution  ------- Dugongs are distributed mostly in Abu Dhabi coastal  waters in and around the seagrass meadows. Most  of  the  dugongs  occur  in  smaller  groups  (group    size  1).  However   large  herds  of  over  100  dugongs   are commonly seen during winter. Mother and calf  grouping  (indicator  of  reproductive  health  of  the   population) with around 12 % of sightings has been  reported  from  Abu  Dhabi  waters.  Dugongs  are   distributed mostly up to a depth of 15 m.

VU  Population  ------- Around 3 000 dugongs occur in Abu Dhabi waters  based on aerial survey conducted from 2004-2015.  They occur in and around seagrass meadows.  Population Trend  ------- Relatively stable.  Threats  -------  By-catch from abandoned/illegal fishing nets causing   the  dugong  to  drown  remains  the  main  threat.   Vessel strikes  degradation of foraging grounds due  to  coastal  developments  as  well  as  other  anthro- pogenic  activities   and  water  pollution  are  factors   that threaten the survivability of this species.  At least 200 dugongs have died in the last 15 years  (17 per year in last 3 years). The main cause of death  found was due to drowning followed by vessel strike.  Loss  of  seagrass  meadows  due  to  dredging   land    filling and pollution are well known and documented.   Seismic  survey  and  activities  related  to  oil  explo-  ration exist but are not quantified. Moreover  there   are indirect threats from climate change.  Conservation Actions Underway  ------- Dugong  conservation  is  a  priority  under  the   Convention  of  Migratory  Species  (CMS)  of  UNEP.   CMS has established a dugong secretariat supported  by  EAD  and  the  government  of  Abu  Dhabi  to   implement conservation actions for the species across  its  range. There  are  currently  common  conservation   action plans  which have been jointly implemented by  all  the  dugong  range  states. The  action  plans  include   but  are  not  limited  to  monitoring  and  research    investigation  of  mortality   ecological  and  biological   studies of the dugong and its habitats  education and  awareness  programmes   as  well  as  data  sharing  and   regional  cooperation.  Protected  areas  have  been   established  for  most  seagrass  areas  and  hunting  for   consumption is banned. Some of the best dugong sites  are  within  EAD’s  marine  protected  areas  such  as   Marawah  Marine  Biosphere  Reserve  and  Al  Yasat   Marine Protected Area. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  6766  Hawksbill Turtle   (Eretmochelys imbricata)  Rationale  -------  Eretmochelys  imbricata   is  broadly  distributed  near   Abu Dhabi coastal shores in and around coral reefs.  The  estimated  population  is  1 000  individuals  and   adult mortality due to threats is between 10 to 15  individuals  (2004-2017)  per  year.  Known  threats   include by-catch and habitat loss. Based on satellite  telemetry   the  total  range  of  foraging  areas  is   estimated at 40-60 km². Moreover  the total range  of nesting sites is estimated at 15 km². This provides  an AOO estimate well below the 500 km². There is  a  continuing  decline  in  the  quality  and  extent  of   coral reef habitat  on which this species is dependent.  This decline in quality and extent of habitat is due to  coral bleaching and other associated factors  driven  by increasing sea surface temperatures. Given this    threat defined less than 5 locations. This species is   assessed as EN .  Distribution  ------- Hawksbill sea turtles have a wide range of distribution   found predominantly in tropical reefs of the Indian    Pacific  and Atlantic Oceans. The species is closely   associated with warm tropical waters. In Abu Dhabi  waters  of  southern  Arabian  Gulf   hawksbills  are   widespread with multiple foraging sites in and around  reef  habitats  and  nest  on  sandy  beaches  of  several   offshore  islands.  Data  from  satellite  tagging   programme  of  post  nesting  hawksbills  reveals  that   the species do not migrate out of the Arabian Gulf.

Al Ameri  H. EN  Population  ------- Aerial survey (2004 – 2015) reveals an estimated a  foraging population of 1 000 (approximately 5 000 is  the  total  sea  turtle  population  of  which  20  %  are   hawksbills  on  the  basis  of  mortality  data).  They   occur  in  and  around  of  coral  meadows  of  near   coastal waters of Abu Dhabi waters. At least 160 to  242 nests per year (2000-2017) have been reported  from Abu Dhabi nesting beaches.  Population Trend  ------- Population trend is stable.  Threats  -------  By-catch from abandoned/ illegal fishing nets  vessel   strikes   degradation  of  foraging  grounds  due  to   climate  change   coastal  developments  as  well  as   other anthropogenic activities  and water pollution  are  factors  that  threaten  the  survivability  of  this   species.  Oil  and  gas  exploration   seismic  surveys   also  impact  hawksbill  turtles  and  their  nesting  and   foraging habitat.  Conservation Actions Underway  ------- UAE  is  signatory  to  IOSEA  Sea  Turtle  MoU.  Abu Dhabi implements conservation actions under  the convention. The action plans include but are not  limited to monitoring and research  investigation of  mortality   ecological  and  biological  studies  of  its   habitats   education  and  awareness  programmes   as   well  as  data  sharing  and  regional  cooperation.  More  research  is  required  relating  to  temperature   and climate change. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  6968  Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise    (Neophocaena phocaenoides)  Rationale  -------  Neophocaena  phocaenoides   is  little  known  in  the   Arabian  Gulf   and  more  particularly  Abu  Dhabi   waters.  The  survey  with  baseline  of  2014-15  and   repeat  survey  of  2017  showed  that  further  repeat   surveys  will  validate  the  data  on  abundance  of  the   species. However  from two surveys that were cond-  ucted in Abu Dhabi coastal waters  the conclusion  is that the species has a very small population (that  can be more than 50 but certainly less than 250)   hence is categorised as Endangered (EN).  Distribution  ------- Distribution  limited  to  the  coastal  waters  of  Asia.   The species is very shy that surfaces quietly  hence   difficult to locate. They occur in small groups of size   1-12 individuals. All sightings are in coastal waters of  Abu Dhabi at a depth up to 15 m.  Population  ------- Abu Dhabi waters contain habitat that is important  for  the  survival  and  recovery  of  threatened  and   declining  species  such  as  Indian  Ocean  humpback    dolphin (IUCN-Endangered)  Indo-pacific bottlenose  dolphin  (IUCN-DD)   finless  porpoise  (IUCN-   Vulnerable)   and  dugong  (IUCN-Vulnerable)  (Preen   2004; Das 2014; Grandcourt  et al.  2015; Díaz López   et al.  2017).

Finless porpoises were observed  for the   first time in all three regions but do not appear very   abundant across most of their range.  Population Trend  ------- Population trend is unknown.  Threats  ------- Coastal  development   oil  and  gas  drilling   seismic    survey  as  well  as  boat  traffic  are  some  of  the    key threats.   Conservation Actions Underway  ------- Protected areas have been established and it is illegal  to  catch  or  hunt  dolphins  in  Abu  Dhabi  as  the   species is protected under Federal Law (24) of 1999.  Long-term  research  and  monitoring  are  already  in    place.  Inter-agency  cooperation  with  fisheries  for  effective  management  of  fisheries  and  fishing   activities is planned. 
 The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  7170  Indian Ocean Humpback  Dolphin  (Sousa plumbea)  Rationale  -------  Sousa  plumbea   is  broadly  distributed  in  Abu  Dhabi   Emirate. Latest population surveys (2017) place the  total number of mature individuals at 554  additionally  was  observed  a  continuing  decline  between  1986   and  1999.  Given  the  small  population  size   this   species  could  easily  become  more  threatened  and   monitoring  of  human-caused  mortality  should  be   emphasised.  For  all  these  reasons  this  species  is   categorised as Vulnerable(VU).  Distribution  ------- Indian  Ocean  Humpback  dolphins  inhabit  shallow   coastal  waters  of  the  tropics.  In  Abu  Dhabi   the   species  is  distributed  along  the  coastal  waters   including   mangrove  channels   natural  and  dredged   channels and bays. They prefer shallow and sheltered  water to open sea.  Population  ------- No absolute data but marine wildlife aerial surveys  suggest  a  seventy  percent  decline  in  small  dolphin   densities  from  1986  to  1999.  As  of  2017  there  are   701 recorded individuals in Abu Dhabi of which 79 %  are adults; this  equals to 554 mature individuals.

Threats  ------- Coastal  development   oil  and  gas  drilling   seismic    survey  as  well  as  boat  traffic  are  some  of  the    key threats.   Conservation Actions Underway  ------- Speed limits are in place for vessels in areas where  this species occurs in high density; this is not very  well  enforced.  Protected  areas  have  been    established  with  implementations  of  dynamic   protected  areas.  Monitoring  the  species  by  direct   observation  or  indirectly   via   hydrophones  as  well     as    inter-agency    cooperation    with    fisheries     for    effective    management    of    fisheries    and     fishing  activities  is  planned.  Furthermore   fishing   regulations   research  and  communications  with   targeted stakeholders is ongoing. 
 The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  7372 The United Arab Emirates has recorded more than 460 bird species  out of these 427 species have been  recorded in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi is important for many breeding bird species. The emirate  supports  the  nearly  all  but  one  breeding  colony  of  the  globally  threatened  Socotra  Cormorant  with  an   estimated  population  of  nearly  50 000  -  60 000  breeding  pairs.  Most  offshore  islands  of  the  emirate  are   important for four breeding terns  of which the Lesser Crested Tern ( Thalasseus bengalensis ) is most numerous.  The only two breeding colonies of Crab Plover ( Dromas ardeola ) are found in Abu Dhabi. Species such as  Sooty Falcon ( Falco concolor ) and Greater flamingo ( Phoenicopterus roseus ) breed only in Abu Dhabi. The bird   fauna of the emirate is not only important locally but also of regional and global significance  given the   presence of some key breeding and wintering species.  For  the  regional  red  listing  exercise   we  assessed  a  total  of  49  species  after  decisions  based  on  different    filters. Out of these  33 were categorised as threatened  out of these ten species were Critically Endangered   (CR)  10 species were evaluated as Endangered (EN) and another 13 species were categorised as Vulnerable  (VU). Nearly 22 % of all the assessed species were Near-threatened while 10 % as Least Concern (LC).   Out of these  species specific action plans have been prepared for the Western Osprey ( Pandion haliaetus )  a  breeding seabird. Breeding species such as Red-billed Tropicbird ( Phaethon aethereus )  Socotra Cormorant  ( Phalacrocorax  nigrogularis )   Western  Osprey   Egyptian  Vulture  ( Neophron  percnopterus )   Saunders’s  Tern   ( Sternula saundersi )  Barn Owl ( Tyto alba )  Pharaoh Eagle-Owl ( Bubo ascalaphus )  Sooty Falcon ( Falco concolor )  and Crab Plover  are being regularly monitored.   4.4  Conservation Status of Birds  in Abu Dhabi Emirate    Shahid Bashir Khan  Shakeel Ahmed & Salim Javed  Introduction  Critically Endangered Endangered Vulnerable Near Threatened Least Concern CR EN VU NT LC   Figure 4.4.1  Status of  bird species assessed.  4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  73  10% 20% 20% 27% 23% 
  The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  7574     Barn Owl   (Tyto alba)   Rationale  -------  Tyto alba  has very small population of < 50 individuals.  Although  its  geographic  range  is  small   there  is  no    evidence  of  decline  or  fluctuation  in  the  area  or   population.  The  species  is  a  resident  breeding    species  without  any  significant  immigration  of   propagules that are likely to reproduce in the region   thus  its  status  remains  unchanged.  Therefore   this   species is categorised as Critically Endangered (CR).  Distribution  ------- The species is recorded in open country with trees  and  semi  desert  near  habitation.  Its  distribution   extends from Al Ain in the south-east along coastal  areas in Abu Dhabi and extends up to Dhafra region.  Population  ------- The current population is estimated to be less than  50  mature  Individuals  or  equal  to  10-20  breeding   pairs (Aspinall 2010).

Javed  S.  CR  Threats  ------- Although there have been no reports of population  declines   it  is  thought  that  numbers  suffer  due  to   habitat alteration and destruction. The species may  suffer persecution as it is considered as bad omen.  Conservation Actions Underway  -------  The species would benefit from the conservation of   natural  sites   some  sites  with  Barn  owl  already   present  in  some  of  the  13  terrestrial  protected   areas in Abu Dhabi. Increased awareness and more   species-specific research and monitoring are already   being  undertaken  in  the  emirate.  This  species  is   protected  under  Federal  Law  24  of  1999  and    Local  Law  22  of  2005  which  prohibits  hunting  of    this species. 
 The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  7776  Black-crowned Night Heron   (Nycticorax nycticorax)  Rationale  ------- The  number  mature  individuals  of   Nycticorax  nycticorax  in Abu Dhabi Emirate is estimated to be  around  70  -100.  The  species  has  restricted   distribution  but there is no evidence of fragmenta-  tion  reduction  and fluctuation  thereby  the species   meets  the  criteria  of  EN.  As  it  is  a  predominantly   winter  visitor  to  Abu  Dhabi  Emirate  and  has  been   recorded breeding recently with no threat outside  the  emirate   as  the  conditions  outside  the  region   area not deteriorating and the breeding population  could  rescue  the  regional  population   it  is  down   listed from Endangered (EN) to Vulnerable (VU).  Distribution  ------- The species is recorded in areas with small water- bodies and along the coast  near islands and newly  created  inland  wetlands.  Its  distribution  extends   along  most  of  the  coastline  and  inland  near    Abu Dhabi and Al Ain.  Population  ------- An  estimated  50  -100  mature  individuals  may  be   present across all sites in Abu Dhabi Emirate.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  7978  Little Grebe   (Tachybaptus ruficollis)   Rationale  -------  Tachybaptus ruficollis  has a small breeding population  with  number  of  mature  individuals  <  1 000  in   Abu  Dhabi  Emirate  and  therefore  it  qualifies  to    be listed as Vulnerable. The population is possibly a  mix  of  breeding  as  well  as  migrants  so  the    species  is  neither  up-listed  nor  down-listed  during    the assessment.   Distribution  ------- The species is found in areas near the coast and well  vegetated water-bodies that are inland in Abu Dhabi  and Al Ain.   Population  ------- The  species  is  found  throughout  Abu  Dhabi   Al  Ain  and  Al  Dhafra  regions.  An  estimated  500- 1 000  individuals  may  be  present  across  all  sites  in   Abu  Dhabi  Emirate  and  is  recorded  largely  from   inland  wetlands.

As the species is a winter migrant to the region and  conditions  of  habitat  are  deteriorating  outside  as   well as inside the region  the species is categorised  as Vulnerable (VU).  Distribution  -------  The species is extensively distributed along mudflats    sandy  beaches   estuaries  and  inland  wetlands.  It  is   distributed  along  coastal  areas  and  islands  all  over   the emirate. It is also recorded in inland wetlands.   Population  ------- An estimated 300-500 individuals.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  8584  Northern Pintail  (Anas acuta)  Rationale  -------  Anas  acuta   has  a  small  population  <  250  mature   individuals  in  Abu  Dhabi  Emirate.  It  is  recorded   during  winter  and  is  relatively  abundant  and  is   regularly recorded from inland wetlands sites across  Abu  Dhabi  Emirate.  The  species  is  migratory  and   there is potentially high rescue effect from individuals  outside of the region. This being a visiting population  with  no  threat  outside  the  region  therefore  and   based  on  small  population  it  is  down-listed  from   Endangered (EN) to Vulnerable (VU).  Distribution  ------- The species is recorded all along the coastal areas in  sheltered  coasts  and  estuaries  and  shallow  inland   waters from the south-east to the western areas of  the emirate.  Population  ------- Estimated  to  be  nearly  75-100  mature  individuals   from  several  sites  across  Abu  Dhabi  and  Al  Ain   regions.  During  the  winter  months   it  is  found  in   areas associated with water – mainly inland wetlands  and sewage treatment plants (treated water areas).

Javed  S.  VU  Population Trend  ------- Population trend is unknown.  Threats  ------- The  most  relevant  threats  within  Abu  Dhabi     are  modification  in  coastal  land-use  and  the   possibility  of  oil  pollution.  Furthermore   wetland   habitat  loss  and  reclamation  of  coastal  areas  for   industrial  development  could  also  be  the  threats    but the severity of these threats towards this species  is unknown.   Conservation Actions Underway  ------- The  species  is  protected  under  Federal  Law  24  of   1999.  It  is  AEWA  listed  species   CMS  Appendix  II    EU Birds Directive Annex II and III. The establishment  of  various  protected  areas  would  ensure   conservation  of  suitable  habitat  and  to  prevent   disturbance.  Systematic  monitoring  of  the  species   along  with  other  avifauna   within  and  outside   protected areas is being undertaken by EAD.
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  8786  Asian Houbara   (Chlamydotis macqueenii)  Rationale  -------  Chlamydotis macqueeni  is globally threatened and the  population is declining. There is also an uncertainty  over whether any of the released individuals in UAE   have  fulfilled  the  requirements  for  acceptance  as   ‘wild’ under IUCN guidelines  and the confusion also  covers  any  wild  population  estimates  within  the   country.  We  assessed  the  species  based  on  small   population  size  <  250  mature  individuals  and  it    qualifies to be listed as Endangered (EN).  Distribution  ------- The species is recorded in stony or sandy steppes   semi-desert  in  areas  of  low  dunes  from  Al  Ain  to  Al Dhafra regions.  Population  ------- Wild  Population  not  exactly  known  in  Abu  Dhabi   Emirate   however  small  wintering  or  on  passage   migrants  have  been  reported  from  some  areas.   Estimation of exact numbers of wild wintering birds   is difficult  and it is suspected to be small with an   estimated  50  -  75  individuals  present  during  the   winter  season.  The  exact  numbers  of  wild  birds   estimation  is  compounded  by  the  fact  that  captive   bred birds have been released in the emirate  some  even without tags.

Javed  S.  EN  Population Trend  ------- Population trend is unknown.  Threats  ------- All  the  global  threats  to  the  species  are  likely  to    be  relevant  the  species’s  current  status  within    Abu  Dhabi   as  they  may  have  contributed  to  its   disappearance  as  a  natural  breeding  species  within   the country  and may continue to impact individuals  that  visit  the  country  during  the  non-breeding   season. Within Abu Dhabi  disturbance to the habitat  from  development  and  unsustainable  hunting  could   be one of the major threats to the species but the  severity of the threats to the species are unknown.   Conservation Actions Underway  ------- In the UAE  this species is protected under Federal  law  number  24  of  1999.  Additionally  the  species  is   listed  in  CITES  Appendix  I  and  CMS  Appendix  II.   Protected  areas  have  been  established  for  the   conservation  of  the  species.  Moreover   captive   breeding  is  being  undertaken  at  large  scale  to   provide birds for hunting (IFHC 2019) and currently  over 50 000 Houbara have been raised in captivity  and  released  across  its  range.  A  network  of   terrestrial protected areas have been established in   the emirate  some specifically to protect wintering   as  well  as  released  Houbara.  The  species  is  also   included  in  EAD’s  education  and  awareness   programme for important and endangered species. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  8988  Bonelli’s Eagle   (Aquila fasciata)  Rationale  -------  Aquila fasciata  is a rare resident and a fairly common  winter  visitor.  Based  on  the  number  of  mature   individuals  the  species  is  categorised  as  Critically   Endangered  (CR).  It  should  be  noted  that  its   geographical  range  in  the  form  of  AOO  is  small.    As  the  local  breeding  population  experiences   immigration from wintering population  which is not  going to change or decrease  accordingly the species  is down-listed from as Critically Endangered (CR) to   Endangered (EN).  Distribution  ------- The species is a rare resident breeding bird and the  nominate  race  is  also  represented  by  wintering   population.  Reported  from  Abu  Dhabi   Al  Ain  and   Al  Dhafra  regions   however  most  sightings  are    confined to Al Ain region  largely around Jabal Hafit.  Population  ------- Estimated  to  be  in  the  range  of  5  -10  mature  birds   from  all  the  sites  in  the  emirate  as  it’s  not  very   common and only few individuals are seen.

Javed  S.  EN  Population Trend  ------- Population trend is unknown.  Threats  ------- Local threats to the species are unknown.  Conservation Actions Underway  ------- The species is protected under Federal law number  24 of 1999 and Local Law 22 of 2005. It is also listed  on the CITES Appendix II.  Jabal  Hafit  has  small  breeding  population  and  establishment  of  the  Jabal  Hafit  Protected  area   possibly helped the species and the small population  at  site   however  prevention  of  disturbance  and   awareness  are  considered  important  activities  for   protection of the species. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  9190  Socotra Cormorant   (Phalacrocorax nigrogularis)  Rationale  -------  The species  is a local resident in Abu Dhabi Emirate.  It is experiencing declines and deterioration of the  conditions  through  its  global  range.  The  species    qualifies to be listed as Endangered (EN) based on  severely  fragmented  and  extreme  fluctuations  in   EOO & AOO  number of locations and number of  mature Individuals .   Distribution  ------- The  species  has  widespread  distribution  in  the   marine areas of the emirate in non-breeding season  and breeds mainly on few offshore islands; however  breeding is limited to 4 - 5 key offshore islands.  Population  ------- The  current  breeding  population  of  the  species  in    Abu Dhabi is around 55 000 breeding pairs from five   offshore island sites in the emirate; however  these   numbers  fluctuate  every  year.  The  numbers   decreased  from  2004  -  2011  and  increased  from   2011-2016  (possibly  attributed  to  colonies  shifting   from neighbouring areas).   Population Trend  ------- Population trend is stable.

Ahmed  S.  Javed  S. EN  Threats  ------- Coastal development on breeding islands is possibly  the greatest threat to the species with detrimental  effects.  Egg  collection  during  the  breeding  season   has  been  one  of  the  major  threats  to  the  species.    Frequent human disturbance flushes parenting birds   from  nests   resulting  in  widespread  egg  and  chick   predation  by  gulls.  Furthermore   persecution  and   hunting at the breeding sites are also the threats.   Conservation Actions Underway  ------- The  species  is  listed  in  CMS  Appendix  II  and   protected  under  Federal  law  number  24  of  1999.   EAD  has  been  regularly  monitoring  breeding   population and will continue to monitor the breeding   sites.  Specific  conservation  measures  have  been   proposed  including the protection of some breeding  sites. The species is also included in EAD’s education  and  awareness  programme  for  important  and   endangered species. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  9392  Crab Plover    (Dromas ardeola)  Rationale  -------  Dromas  ardeola    based  on  its  small  number  of   locations  small area of occupancy < 20 000 km² and   the decline in the quality of its habitat qualifies to be   for  listed  as  Vulnerable  (VU).  The  breeding   population is stable in Abu Dhabi  thus the regional  adjustment was not applied.    Distribution  ------- Outside  the  breeding  season  the  species  could  be   seen at key coastal sites throughout the emirate and  during the breeding season the species is restricted  to two islands in Abu Dhabi Emirate.  Population  ------- On an average 1 300 - 1 500  breeding pairs (appro- ximately  3 000  mature  individuals)  are  known  to   breed on the two islands and the population seems  to  be  stable  with  some  inter-annual  variations    in numbers.   Population Trend  ------- Breeding population is stable.

Javed  S. VU  Threats  ------- The  species  is  restricted  to  only  two  islands    during breeding period  of which the largest colony  is on a privately owned island and remains vulnerable  to  development   anthropogenic  activities  and   potential  introduction  of  nest  predators  onto   breeding islands.   Conservation Actions Underway  ------- The species is protected under the Federal Law 24  of  1999  and  is  also  listed  in  the  CMS  Appendix  II.   The  species  is  relatively  well  protected  at    Abu Al Abyad  which supports 90 % of the breeding  population  in  the  UAE.  The  other  nesting  site     Umm Amim is part of the Marawah Marine Biosphere  Reserve  and  is  well  protected.  Annual  breeding   assessments  have  been  undertaken  by  EAD  since   2002 and will continue to be monitored. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  9594  Cream-colored Courser    (Cursorius cursor)  Rationale  -------  Cursorius cursor  is a resident breeder and some birds  migrate during winter. At sites where the species is  recorded it is not seen in large numbers. There has   also  been  an  ongoing  significant  reduction  in   population due to alteration of habitat as the species  depends upon low dune sparse vegetation habitat. A  population of 200 pairs was estimated for the whole  UAE in the1990’s which has undergone decline due  to  habitat  alterations.  There  are  an  estimated  200   individuals  with an inferred decline that is continuing.  Thus based on the most probable number of mature  individuals   it  is  listed  preliminarily  under  Critically   Endangered (CR). As conditions are not favourable  for the species in terms of habitat changes and loss  and the migrant population is not very large to effect  numbers to a large extent  thus the category does  not change.   Distribution  ------- The  species  is  mostly  recorded  in  stony  semi-  desert  areas  and  desert  with  scanty  vegetation  of   Abu Dhabi. It is mostly seen between Abu Dhabi to  Al Ain truck road and Dubai to Al Ain road.

Ahmed  S.  Javed  S. CR  Population  ------- Current population is estimated to be less than 200  mature individuals. Nearly 100 breeding pairs were  estimated in 1997 from all the sites in the emirate.  Population Trend  ------- Population trend is decreasing.  Threats  ------- Destruction and alteration to breeding habitat is the  foremost threat to the species which mostly include  the  irreversible  conversion  of  suitable  habitat  for   development.  Disturbance  in  the  form  of  people’s   presence is detrimental during breeding.  Conservation Actions Underway  ------- The  species  is  protected  under  Federal  Law  24  of   1999. Establishment of various protected area would  ensure  conservation  of  suitable  habitat  and  to   prevent disturbance. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  9796  Pharaoh Eagle-Owl    (Bubo ascalaphus)  Rationale  -------  Bubo ascalaphus  is an uncommon to fairly common  breeding resident with very low numbers seen. The  population  is  under  threat  from  habitat  alteration    and disturbance. There are significant threats to the   habitat  which  are  increasing.  The  species  being  a   breeding resident does not receive any immigrants  as  migrants  and  therefore  it  is  categorises  as   Critically Endangered (CR).  Distribution  ------- The  species  is  widespread   in  varied  habitat  types   such  as  mountains   areas  with  crags  and  rocky   outcrops  and  sandy  desert  with  large  trees  and   bushes.  The  species  is  distributed  from  the  south- east to the western most areas of the emirate.   Population  ------- Estimated  to  be  nearly  50-60  mature  individuals   which form 10-20 breeding pairs from all the sites in  the emirate. The species is an uncommon to fairly  common breeding resident with very low numbers.

Ahmed  S.  Javed  S. CR  Population Trend  ------- Population trend is decreasing.  Threats  ------- Destruction and alteration to breeding habitat is the  foremost threat to the species which mostly include  the  irreversible  conversion  of  suitable  habitat  for   development.  Disturbance  in  the  form  of  people’s   presence  is  detrimental  during  breeding.  Extensive   use  of  rodenticide  causes  declines  in  the  species   prey base.  Conservation Actions Underway  ------- The  species  is  protected  under  Federal  Law  24  of   1999. Establishment of various protected area would  ensure  conservation  of  suitable  habitats  and  to   prevent  disturbance.  Systematic  monitoring  of  the   species  within and outside protected areas is being  undertaken.  The  species  is  also  included  in  EAD’s   education and awareness programme for important  and endangered species. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  9998  Egyptian Vulture     (Neophron percnopterus)  Rationale  -------  Neophron  percnopterus   has  a  very  small  population   size < 50 mature individuals and its population trend  is  decreasing.  The  species  is  a  breeding  resident     rarely  observed  away  from  Jabal  Hafit   Al Ain;   possibly  also  rare  migrant.  The  number  of  birds   recorded  has  declined  over  the  years  and  the   reduction  is  more  than  50  %  in  three  generations.   Also   its  geographical  range  both  in  the  form  of   EOO and AOO is very small. As  the  Egyptian  Vulture  is  a  resident  (potential   breeding) species in Abu Dhabi Emirate and localised   only to one site in Al Ain region and hence the final   category would not change and remain as Critically  Endangered (CR).  Distribution  -------  The species has localised distribution in Jabal Hafit   mountain in Al Ain  where the species breeds. Seen  as  far  as  Qasr  al  Sarab  when  birds  are  looking    for food.  Population  ------- Estimated  to  be  nearly  50  -  60  mature  individuals   which form 10 - 20 breeding pairs from all the sites in  the emirate. The species is an uncommon to fairly  common breeding resident with very low numbers.

Ahmed  S.  Javed  S. CR  Population Trend  ------- Population trend is decreasing.  Threats  ------- The main threats are possible poisoning of livestock  that is mainly used as bait against fox and a general  issue with food availability.   Conservation Actions Underway  ------- The  species  is  protected  under  Federal  Law  24  of    1999.  Establishment  of  Jabal  Hafit  protected  area   has ensured conservation of suitable habitat. Other  conservation  efforts  underway  are  awareness    and education  satellite tagging / research / camera  trapping.  Five  individuals  have  been  tagged  and   satellite  tracked  by  EAD.  Camera  traps  have  been   set  up  in  areas  where  food  was  provisioned  on  an   experimental basis.

They are a winter migrant to the region with some   overwintering flocks.  Although  the  species  has  a  visiting  population    this  species  is  categorised  as  Endangered  (EN)    due  to  the  vulnerability  and  threats  to  coastal   wetlands habitats.  Distribution  ------- The species is largely reported from inland wetland  sites  in  Abu  Dhabi   Al  Ain  and  there  are  a    few  records  of  a  single  bird  in  Sir  Baniyas  Island    in  Al  Dhafra  region.  Small  groups  of  birds  are   recorded  regularly  in  Bul  Syayeef  and  Mangrove   National parks.  Population  ------- Estimated  to  be  nearly  50  -  60  mature  individuals   which form 10 - 20 breeding pairs from all the sites in  the emirate.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  103102  Ferruginous Duck    (Aythya nyroca)  Rationale  -------  Aythya nyroca  is a winter migrant to inland wetlands  and is mostly recorded in the newly formed sewage  treatment  plants  in  very  low  numbers.  The   cumulative numbers are not more than 200 - 300 in  a  season.  Two  inland  wetlands  of  Al  Wathba  and   Zakher have most of these birds. Based on the small  numbers   the  species  meets  the  criteria  to  be   considered  as  Vulnerable.  Also   its  geographical   range  is  very  small   both  in  the  form  of  EOO    and AOO.  However  as the species is a winter migrant and has  a small visiting population that faces threats outside  the  region  with  no  rescue  effect   the  category   remains as Vulnerable (VU).  Distribution  ------- The  species  is  mostly  recorded  from  shallow  and   well  vegetated  wetlands  from  15  -  20  sites  across   Abu  Dhabi   Al  Ain  and  Al  Dhafra  regions.  The   species  however  is  more  abundant  in  Zakher  lake   and Al Wathba Wetland Reserve.  Population  ------- Estimated  200  -  300  mature  individuals  could  be   seen across the emirate.

The  species  is  a  winter  visitor  to  the  region  and   does  not  face  any  threats  in  other  regions  of  its    distribution  as such the final category is down-listed   as Vulnerable (VU).   Distribution  ------- The species is largely reported from inland wetland  sites  in  Abu  Dhabi   Al  Ain  and  Al  Dhafra  region.   Large  proportion  of  the  birds  are  recorded  in    Al Wathba and Zakher.  Population  ------- An  estimated  100  -  150  individuals  may  be  present   across all sites in Abu Dhabi Emirate and is recorded  largely from inland wetlands.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  111110  Great Knot    (Calidris tenuirostris)  Rationale  -------  Calidris  tenuirostris   has  a  very  small  population  size   < 50 mature individuals in the emirate. Although the  species  is  winter  migrant  and  local  population  can   have rescue effect  the species is not down listed due  to the small and declining global population and hence  the species is retained as Critically Endangered (CR).   Distribution  ------- The  species  is  recorded  from  a  few  sites  like    Al  Mirfa  in  Al  Dhafra  and  Belghalam  island  and    Jazirat Hayl in Abu Dhabi Emirate.  Population  ------- The  species  is  uncommon  passage  migrant  and   winter visitor to the emirate largely from August to  April  –  however   the  more  recent  sighting  were   recorded from Mirfa in Al Dhafra Region  Belghalam  Island  and  Jazirat  Hayl  in  Abu  Dhabi  Emirate.   Furthermore   important  coastal  sites  such  as   Marawah Island from where the largest numbers of  Great  Knots  were  reported.  Furthermore   limited    research made it very difficult to obtain accurate  population figures. However  nearly 20 - 50 mature   individuals  may  be  present  across  3  -  4  localities  in   Abu Dhabi.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  113112  Greater Spotted Eagle    (Clanga clanga)  Rationale  -------  Clanga  clanga   has  a  small  population  size  of  <50   mature  individuals   therefore  it  is  categorised  as   Critically Endangered (CR). Although the species is  a winter visitor and local population can have rescue  effect   the  species  is  not  down-listed  due  to  the   small and declining global population.   Distribution  ------- The  species  is  recorded  from  a  few  sites  like    Al Mirfa in Al Dhafra and Belghalam island and Jazirat  Hayl in Abu Dhabi Emirate.  Population  ------- The species is a passage and winter visitor to UAE;  it is recorded around coastal areas from Al Dhafra  Region  and  Abu  Dhabi.  It  is  also  recorded  near    artificial fresh-water wetlands with abundant prey   (small  waterbirds   ducks).  It  is  recorded  in  Zakher   lakes and Ain Al Fayda in Al Ain during the migration  season.  It  is  sometimes  seen  near  rubbish  tips   outside towns.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  115114  Lappet-faced Vulture     (Torgos tracheliotos)  Rationale  -------  Torgos  tracheliotos   has  a  very  small  population  in    Abu Dhabi < 50 mature individuals. Due to the rapid  decline in number of individuals  the species is listed  as  endangered  on  a  global  scale.  Therefore    population  outside  of  the  country  may  not  have  a   large  rescue  effect  thus  the  threat  category  is   assessed as Critically Endangered (CR).  Distribution  ------- The  species  is  recorded  from  semi-desert  with   scattered tress  foothills and rocky wadis. It is rarely  seen  visitor  and  is  recorded  from  areas  in  and    around  Jabal  Hafit  mountain  in  Al Ain.  Individuals   from nesting sites in Oman sometimes range across  to  the  UAE.  Individuals  may  disperse  over  large   areas in search of food.  Population  ------- The  species  is  rare  and  uncommon  in  Abu  Dhabi   Emirate.  The  species  is  regularly  observed  -  very   few in numbers in a cross border strip to the west  of  Hajar  Mountain  between  Al  Ain  and  Al  Hayer.   The  individuals  from  nesting  sites  in  Oman   sometimes  range  across  to  the  UAE.  The  non- breeding  population  size  is  estimated  8  -10  mature    individuals  seen  regularly  around  Jabal  Hafit  mountain  in  Al Ain  and  there  is  no  confirmed   breeding recorded from the area.

Ahmed  S.  Javed  S. CR  Population Trend  ------- Population trend is unknown.  Threats  ------- The  species  is  globally  threatened  and  is  known  to   face  a  very  large  range  of  threats  that  are  having  a   severe  impact  on  the  global  population.  The  dead   domestic livestock forms their principle food source  (Aspinall  1996)  in  their  breeding  range  in  the   neighbouring  countries  and  such  material  is  may  be    less  available  in  Al Ain  close  to  the  Jabal  Hafit   mountain.  Food  scarcity  could  be  one  of  the  main   threat to the species along with suitable undisturbed   breeding  sites  near  Jabal  Hafit  mountain.  Use  of   NSAID  (Diclofenac)  in  livestock  in  South  Asian  and   African countries has brought several Gyps vultures’  species  to  the  brink  of  an  extinction.  In  the  UAE    there  is  no  evidence  of  any  local  susceptibility    of  diclofenac  poisoning  but  this  should  be    closely monitored.  Conservation Actions Underway   ------- Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation  of  Migratory  Birds  of  Prey  in  Africa  and  Eurasia   Raptor (MoU) has developed a Vulture Multispecies  Action  Plan  to  conserve  African-Eurasian  Vulture   (Vulture MsAP). The species is protected under the  Federal Law 24 of 1999  which prohibits hunting of  the  species.  In  addition   this  species  is  in  CMS   Appendix I as well as CITES Appendix II. The species  is  currently  held  in  Al  Ain  Zoo  and  should  be   available  for  a  breeding  and  release  programme  in   future.  Establishment  of  terrestrial  protected  area    such  as  Jabal  Hafit  and  habitat  conservation   programmes is in place. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  117116  Western Osprey    (Pandion haliaetus)  Rationale  -------  Pandion haliaetus  has a very small breeding population   in Abu Dhabi < 250 mature individuals that qualifies   it as Endangered. The species may experience rescue  effect  from  the  regional  population  but  the    EAD’s  satellite  telemetry  studies  have  shown  the    Abu Dhabi population as a source population in the  UAE  as young birds have dispersed from the emirate  to other neighbouring countries in the Arabian Gulf  and Oman. Thus  the threat category is retained as  Endangered (EN).  Distribution  ------- Osprey is widely distributed on most of the islands  in  Abu  Dhabi  Emirate   always  seen  near  waters    inland or coastal. Inland wetlands in Al Ain also have  occasional  records.  Species  is  resident  and  breeds   on near shore and offshore islands of Abu Dhabi in  Al Dhafra region.   Population  ------- The  species  is  widely  distributed  on  most  of  the   islands in Abu Dhabi Emirate. Abu Dhabi holds the  bulk   if  not  the  entire   UAE  breeding  population.

Javed  S. EN Emirate  wide  breeding  population  surveys   undertaken  by  EAD  have  shown  that  the  current   breeding population is estimated to be 100 breeding  pairs or 200 mature individuals.   Population Trend  ------- Population trend is stable.  Threats  ------- The species is relatively well protected and to some   extent  have  benefited  from  provision  of  nesting   islands.  However   introduction  of  invasive  species   such  as  feral  cats/ground  predators  on  breeding   sites  are  considered  having  an  adverse  effect  on   breeding  population  of  the  species.  Furthermore    oil   residential  or  industrial  development    degradation  and  disturbance  at  the  breeding  sites   are  major  threats  to  the  species.  In  addition    connection of islands to the mainland may results in  desertion by nesting pairs.   Conservation Actions Underway   ------- The  species  is  well  protected  under  the  Federal  Law  24  of  1999.  The  species  is  also  listed  in  the  CITES  Appendix  II  and  CMS  Appendix  II  of  the    Raptors MOU. Some of the sites are already well protected under  the  marine  protected  areas  network.  Additionally    the  species  has  potentially  benefited  from  the  provision  of  the  artificial  nesting  platforms   thus   offsetting any loss of nesting site from development  on few islands. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  119118  Pallid Harrier    (Circus macrourus)  Rationale  -------  Circus  macrourus   has  a  very  small  migratory   population  in  Abu  Dhabi  Emirate  <  250  mature   individuals and therefore it has been categorised as  Endangered. The species is migrant and the breeding  populations  from  outside  of  the  country  can  have   rescue effect; therefore  the species is down-listed  to Vulnerable (VU).  Distribution  ------- The  species  is  a  reasonably  common  at  key  inland   sites  and  forestry  areas  in  Abu  Dhabi   Al  Ain  and    Al Dhafra regions  even in remote Liwa desert due  to plantations.  Population  ------- The  individuals  have  been  recorded  from  different   habitats  in  the  terrestrial  protected  areas.

Javed  S. VU  Population Trend  ------- Population trend is unknown.  Threats  ------- Habitat degradation is one of the threats to all the  raptors  species  in  UAE.  Outside  of  its  breeding   grounds  (and  so  potentially  of  relevance  to    the population within UAE)  the species is thought  to  be  negatively  affected  by  the  loss  of  grassland    due  to  overgrazing.  Although  this  requires  further   research; and the overall scope and severity of these  threats  for  the  population  that  visits  UAE  is   essentially unknown.  Conservation Actions Underway   ------- The  species  is  listed  in  Appendix  II  of  CITES     Annex II of the Bonn and Bern Conventions and in  Annex  I  of  the  EU  Birds  Directive.  Raptors  MOU    CMS  Appendix  II.  In  the  UAE   this  species  is   protected  under  Federal  Law  24  of  1999   which   prohibits  hunting  of  this  species.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  121120  Red-billed Tropicbird    (Phaethon aethereus)  Rationale  -------  Phaethon  aethereus   has  a  very  small  breeding   population  in  Abu  Dhabi  Emirate.  Although    significant  reduction  has  been  recorded  from  an   offshore  island  in  Abu  Dhabi  called  ‘Jarnein  Island’   where  currently  no  birds  have  been  recorded  to   breed  since  last  three  years   however  we  suspect   that  these  breeding  individuals  have  shifted  to  the   neighbouring islands  where they have been recorded  to  breed  in  the  past.  Based  on  the  numbers  of    mature individuals < 250 the species qualified to be   listed as Endangered (EN).  Distribution  ------- The  species  breeds  on  three  off-shore  islands  of   Jarnein   Zirku  and  Arzanah  in  the  winter  months.   Post-breeding   the  birds  are  known  to  disperse   widely and one of the tagged Red-billed Tropic bird  was found near the coast in South India.   Population  ------- The species is only known to breed on a few offshore  islands in Abu Dhabi Emirate. Within Abu Dhabi  the  species breeds on Jernein  Zirku and Arzana islands in  winter season. EAD has conducted annual population  counts surveys for the species on Jernain Island since   Distribution Map  Red-billed Tropicbird  (Phaethon aethereus)  Local Red List Assessment Category   Endangered D  Global Red List Assessment   2018 Least Concern (LC)   Assessors   Khan  S.B.  Ahmed  S.  Javed  S. EN 2005.  During  2008   the  highest  recorded  numbers   were  220  breeding  pairs  followed  by  150  pairs  in    2010. The number of breeding pairs have significantly   declined  on  Jernain  Island.  Currently  there  is  not  a   single breeding pairs left on this island; however  it is   quite  possible  that  the  birds  have  shifted  to   neighbouring  Arzanah  Island.  Furthermore   it  is   suspected that at least 75 breeding pairs are present  on the neighbouring islands.   Population Trend  ------- Population trend is decreasing on one island but may  be stable on other two.  Threats  ------- Introduction  of  invasive  species  and  ground   predators such as feral cats to control rats on the   islands had adverse effect on significant reduction of   breeding  pairs  on  Zirku  and  Arzanah.  In  addition    disturbance  to  the  habitat  (people  presence)  on   Jarnein  islands  may  be  the  reason  for  the   abandonment of nesting habitat.   Conservation Actions Underway   -------  The species would benefit from the conservation of   the  natural  rocky  habitats  of  the  islands   regular   monitoring of breeding birds have been undertaken  over  the  last  15  years  by  EAD  and  some  other   actions such as rodents and pest control measures  have  been  taken  by  the  island  management.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  123122  Sand Partridge    (Ammoperdix heyi)  Rationale  -------  Ammoperdix heyi  is a species with a very restricted  geographical range. It is also a species with very a  small population size and categorised as Endangered  based on < 250 mature individuals. However as the  population  from  other  emirates  along  its   distribution range in the Hajar mountains can have  a  rescue  effect   therefore  the  species  is  down- listed to Vulnerable (VU).   Distribution  ------- The species is found in arid-rocky and stony slopes   wadis  and  cliffs.  It  is  a  resident  breeding  species     largely  localised  to  Jabal  Hafit  mountains  in   Al Ain region.  Population  ------- The species is a resident breeding population  largely   localised to Jabal Hafit mountains in Al Ain region.   This  species  is  absent  from  the  western  region  of   Abu  Dhabi  Emirate.  Population  surveys  conducted   by  EAD  have  shown  that  an  estimated  200-250    individual may be present on Jabal Hafit mountian   from where they have been regularly recorded in a  family of 10 - 20 individuals.

Threats  ------- The major threats to the species are loss of habitats  from  land  use  changes   disturbance  and  more   recently from the reintroduced Arabian Partridges  may have impact on the resident breeding population  of  the  species.  Recreation  and  hunting  within  the   species’s  occupied  range  could  have  an  impact    reducing  local  numbers  and  potentially  leading  to   individuals changing their behavioural patterns.   Conservation Actions Underway   -------  The area has already been established as Jabal Hafit   Protected  area   however  despite  protected  area   establishment  the area and the species therein may  be vulnerable from development and other activities.  In addition  this species is protected under Federal  Law  24  of  1999  and  Local  Law  22  of  2005   which   prohibits hunting of this species. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  125124  Saunders’s Tern    (Sternula saundersi)  Rationale  -------  Sternula saundersi  has a small breeding population in  Abu  Dhabi  <  1 000  mature  individuals  and  this    number has significantly decreased over the years.   In  the  wider  Arabian  Peninsula   the  number  of    mature individuals are fluctuating or in decline  local   population  is  unlikely  to  receive  a  rescue  effect    therefore   the  species  is  listed  as  Critically    Endangered (CR).   Distribution  ------- Quite  widespread  on  the  nearshore  and  offshore   islands  as  well  as  coastal  areas  and  occasionally   recorded in inland wetlands. Some of the important  sites in Abu Dhabi Emirate are Al Yasat  Salaha and  Bul Syayeef Marine Protected Area (MPA).  Population  ------- The  species  is  quite  widespread  on  the  nearshore   and  offshore  islands  as  well  as  coastal  areas  and   occasionally recorded in inland wetlands.

However  historic data (1996) indicates the presence  of  500  -1 000  breeding  pairs  in  the  UAE   with  the   bulk in Abu Dhabi; this represents a marked more  than 75 % reduction over last 25 years.  Population Trend  ------- Population trend is decreasing.  Threats  ------- The  major  threats  to  this  species  come  from  the   loss of breeding sites due to coastal developments   predation by cats  rats and foxes. Oil pollution and  destruction and disturbance to the habitat (people  presence) on nearshore and offshore can lead to the  abandonment of nesting habitat.   Conservation Actions Underway   ------- The species is listed in CMS Appendix II  and would   benefit from the conservation of the natural sandy   habitats  of  the  near  shore  and  offshore  islands.   Regular  monitoring  of  breeding  birds  have  been   undertaken  over  the  last  15  years  by  EAD  to   understand  population  trends.  This  species  is  also   protected  under  Federal  Law  24  of  1999  and    Local  Law  22of  2005   which  prohibits  hunting  of    this species. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  127126  Sociable Lapwing    (Vanellus gregarius)  Rationale  -------  Vanellus  gregarius   has  a  very  small  population  not   only in Abu Dhabi but also in UAE. The species is in  rapid  decline  on  a  global  scale.  Consequently    breeding  populations  outside  of  the  country  may   not have a large rescue effect. Therefore  the species  is categorised as Critically Endangered (CR).

Ahmed  S.  Javed  S. CR  Threats  -------  This species is of global significance given its global   listing  as  Critically  Endangered.  It  is  likely  that  the   main causes of the global decline come from outside  of UAE  and so these external threats are likely the  main  threats  to  the  population  that  visits  the    country.  The  specific  threats  to  the  species  in    Abu  Dhabi  is  not  known.  The  species  may  be   affected  by  the  increasingly  dry  climate  in  its    breeding and wintering ranges  but it is not clear if   this benefits or threatens this semi-desert species.  Conservation Actions Underway   ------- The species is listed in CMS Appendix I. This species  is protected under Federal Law 24 of 1999 and Local  Law  22  of  2005   which  prohibits  hunting  of  this   species.  Population  monitoring  is  continued  within   the Abu Dhabi at different monitoring sites by EAD  to record distribution of the species and to identify  the possible threats at local level. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  129128  Sooty Falcon    (Falco concolor)  Rationale  -------  Falco concolor  has a very small breeding population in  Abu Dhabi < 50 mature individuals. The population is  declining  rapidly  within  the  country  (>  80  %)   and   throughout  its  global  range  principally  for  loss  of   habitat quality  invasive predators and illegal captures.  The potential for immigration from outside the UAE  is low and decreasing further. Therefore  the species  is categorised as Critically Endangered (CR).  Distribution  ------- The species is localised on islands and inland desert  cliffs  of  the  western  region  in  the  pre-breeding   season. Pairs concentrate on a few islands during in  the breeding season.  Pre  and  post-breeding  migration  movements  are   widely  dispersed  and  the  species  is  reported  from   all of Al Dhafra region.  Population  ------- The species is only known to breed on the western  islands  of  Abu  Dhabi  Emirate  in  the  UAE.

The number  of  breeding  pairs  have  apparently  declined  in  the   UAE  from  more  than  14  -  25  breeding  pairs  nearly   three  decades  ago  to  the  current  population  of   (2 - 3) breeding pairs.   Population Trend  ------- Population trend is decreasing in Abu Dhabi.    Threats  ------- Development on some of the breeding islands have  been responsible for loss of breeding sooty falcons  from  islands  such  as  Delma  and  Sir  Bani  Yas.   Development  of  the  islands  in  western  Abu  Dhabi   has further affected the small breeding population of  the UAE. Additional invasive predators at breeding  sites  and  disturbance  from  people’s  presence  and   occasional  trapping  and  capture  as  non-target   species are also some of the threats.  Conservation Actions Underway   ------- The  species  is  under  the  Raptors  MOU   CMS   Appendix II. Draft Sooty falcon action plan has been  prepared  under  the  aegis  of  CMS.  Main  nesting   Island  has  been  included  in  the  Yasat  Marine   Protected Area. Additionally provision of nest boxes  have  been  attempted  and  regular  awareness  is   raised.

The  population  trend     is  unknown  and  no  specific  threats  have  been   recorded.  Therefore   it  is  considered  as  VU.  The   species is a resident breeding in Abu Dhabi. However  as  it  is  unlikely  that  the  population  experiences   immigration  the assessed category would remain as  Vulnerable (VU).  Distribution  ------- The  species  is  a  resident  breeding  bird   largely   restricted to mangroves and also occurs in suitable  mainland  and  island  sites.  It  occurs  across  the    Abu  Dhabi  Emirate  from  areas  in  the  Al  Ain  and    Al Dhafra regions.  Population  ------- This  species  is  a  common  resident  along  coastal   areas of Abu Dhabi; but uncommon to rare  further  inland. The species is largely restricted to mangroves  and  occurs  in  suitable  mainland  and  island  sites.  It   has  been  reported  to  occur  from  over  75  sites   across  Abu  Dhabi   Al  Ain  and  Al  Dhafra  regions.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  133132  Tufted Duck    (Aythya fuligula)  Rationale  -------  Aythya  fuligula   has  a  very  low  (<  50  )number  of   mature individuals in Abu Dhabi. For that reason is  categorised as CR. It also has restricted distribution  in  Abu  Dhabi.  However   as  the  probability  of   individuals  exchange  with  populations  outside  of   Abu  Dhabi  is  high   the  species  was  down-listed  to   Endangered (EN).  Distribution  ------- The species is recorded during winter months from  coastal  sites   inland  freshwater  lakes  and  pools   across  Abu  Dhabi   Al  Ain  and  Al  Dhafra  regions.   The  species  however  is  more  abundant  in  Zakher   lake and Al Wathba Wetland Reserve.   Population  ------- The species is recorded during winter months as an  overwintering  bird  from  15  -  20  sites  across    Abu  Dhabi   Al  Ain  and  Al  Dhafra  regions.  The   species  however  is  more  abundant  in  Zakher  Lake   and Al Wathba Wetland Reserve from where 25 - 30  individuals have been regularly reported during the  winter  season.  Furthermore   10  -  30  mature   individuals may be present at any given time across  10 sites in Abu Dhabi Emirate from where they have   been reported.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  135134  Water Rail    (Rallus aquaticus)  Rationale  -------  Rallus  aquaticus   has  a  relatively  restricted  distri- bution. However  the number of mature individuals  is very low < 50. For that reason is categorised as  Critically Endangered (CR). However  as the species  has a visiting population in Abu Dhabi and for the  probability  of  rescue  by  breeding  populations   outside of Abu Dhabi  the category is down-listed  to Endangered (EN).  Distribution  ------- An  uncommon  winter  visitor  to  the  UAE   the   species has been reported from seven sites across  Abu  Dhabi   from  Al  Wathba  to  Al  Ain  and  in  Sila    and Ruwais.    Population  ------- The species in the UAE is possibly a casual breeder  and uncommon winter visitor in wetlands habitats.  The species has been recorded from seven localities  of  different  habitats  from  Al  Wathba  Wetland  in   Abu Dhabi to Al Ain region and in Al Dhafrah region.  The visiting population may be in the range of only  10 - 15 individuals across all the sites.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  137136  Western Marsh-harrier    (Circus aeruginosus)  Rationale  -------  Circus aeruginosus  has a very small visiting population   in Abu Dhabi Emirate  which qualifies it for listing it   as Endangered (EN). In the wider Arabian Peninsula   the population is considered to be stable. Therefore   breeding  populations  outside  of  the  country  may   immigrate into the UAE and thus have a large rescue  effect. Therefore  the species has been down-listed  as Vulnerable (VU).    Distribution  ------- The species is a very common winter migrant to the  emirate and is regularly seen at key inland wetlands   coastal wetlands  forestry areas and occasionally on  some islands.      Population  ------- The species is a very common winter migrant to the  emirate and is regularly seen at key inland wetlands   coastal wetlands  forestry areas and occasionally on  some islands.

Ahmed  S.  Javed  S. VU  Population Trend  ------- Population trend stable.  Threats  ------- Habitat degradation is one of the main threats to all  the  raptors  species  in  the  UAE.  Outside  of  its   breeding grounds (and so potentially of relevance to  the population within UAE)  the species is thought  to be negatively affected by the loss of grassland due  to  overgrazing.  Although  this  requires  further   research; and the overall scope and severity of these  threats  for  the  population  that  visits  UAE  is   essentially unknown. However  hunting is one of the   major threats identified to the species in Abu Dhabi  as  one  of  the  tagged  bird  -  fitted  with  satellite   transmitter by EAD was shot-down in Al Houbara  Protected area in Abu Dhabi.     Conservation Actions Underway  ------- The species is listed in CMS Appendix II and CITES   Appendix  II.  The  species  would  benefit  from  the   conservation  of  the  natural  habitats  such  as  in  the   inland  wetland  and  forestry  plantations.  EAD  is   monitoring its population in the inland wetlands and  other  sites  for  last  15  years  and  has  undertaken   satellite  tracking  of  the  species  to  understand  its   migratory route and potential breeding areas. This  species  is  also  protected  under  Federal  Law  24  of   1999  and  Local  Law  22  of  2005   which  prohibits   hunting of this species. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  139138  Cinereous Bunting    (Emberiza cineracea)  Rationale  -------  Emberiza  cineracea   has  a  relatively  restricted   distribution   but  threats  and  number  of  locations   are  unknown.  However   the  number  of  mature   individuals  is  very  low  (<  50)   for  that  reason    it  is  categorised  as  Critically  Endangered  (CR).    Because  of  the  high  probability  of  rescue  by  birds    outside  Abu  Dhabi   the  species  is  down-listed  to    Endangered (EN).  Distribution  ------- Species is a rare to uncommon winter migrant and  is seen in small numbers during spring on dry rocky  slopes  with  sparse  vegetation   also  semi-desert  or   busy wadis. An estimated 10 - 15 individuals could be  present from approximately 15 - 20 sites distributed  widely  across  Abu  Dhabi  Emirate   including    Abu  Dhabi  island   Jebel  Dhanna  and  coastal  areas   upto Sila.     Population  ------- The  species  is  rare  to  uncommon  winter  migrant   from  late  March  to  mid-May  and  seen  in  small   numbers  during  spring  season  in  the  emirate.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  143142  89% 4%   4%3%  In Abu Dhabi Emirate there are about 46 species of terrestrial reptiles and 2 amphibian species. Lizards are  represented  by  35  species   there  is  one  amphisbaenidae  and  11  snake  species  from  four  main  families.   Terrestrial reptiles within Abu Dhabi Emirate can be found from offshore islands  coastal dunes to the inland   mega-dunes  gravel plains and on Jabal Hafit the only mountainous range in the emirate. Reptiles have also   been recorded from some extreme and harsh habitats such as sabkhas which harbours the specialised Gulf  sand gecko ( Pseudoceramodactylus khobarensis ) that is adapted to live in this harsh ecosystem. The Persian  Horned Viper ( Pseudocerates persicus ) and Sinai Agama ( Pseudotrapelus sinaitus ) are only found on Jabal Hafit   as they are specialised mountain species.  Out of a total of 26 reptiles and 2 amphibians assessed; one species is Critically Endangered (CR)  one species   is Vulnerable (VU)  one species is Data Deficient (DD)  and 25 are Least Concern(which include 23 reptiles   and 2 amphibians). The Wonder Gecko ( Teratoscincus keyserlingii ) is listed as Critically Endangered (CR) as its key habitat along  the coastal dunes stretching from Abu Dhabi to the Northern Emirates are under high development pressure.  A recent genetic survey found all UAE populations to be the same as those found in Central Asia with little  genetic variation this has enabled better conservation actions when any mitigation plans are put into place.  A similar genetic study is also being done for the Spiny-tailed lizard ( Uromastyx aegyptia )  which is listed as  Vulnerable (VU) to enable better decision making when any mitigation actions have to be undertaken.   4.5  Conservation Status of Terrestrial Reptiles  and Amphibians in Abu Dhabi Emirate   Pritpal Soorae & Ahmed Ali Mohamed  Introduction  Figure 4.5.1  Status of   reptile species assessed.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  145144  Egyptian Spiny-tailed Lizard    (Uromastyx aegyptia)  Rationale  ------- For  the  purpose  of  this  assessment  we  are   considering  Uromastyx aegyptia  at a species level as  we  are  in  the  process  of  undertaking  a  UAE  wide   genetic  study  on  this  species.   Uromastyx  aegyptia   exhibit a patchy distribution range within Abu Dhabi  Emirate. There has been a decline of 30 % over the  last  45  years.  The  causes  of  this  decline  can  be   attributed  to  habitat  loss  due  to  development   activities   and  some  level  of  exploitation  of  the   species.  Hence   this  species  is  categorised  as   Vulnerable (VU).  Distribution  ------- This species range extends from the west starting in  Egypt  across  the  Arabian  Peninsula  into  Oman  in   the East. In the north it extends up to Syria and Iraq.  Within  the  UAE  this  species  is  mainly  found  on    gravel plain areas and in lithified sand dunes. In these   types of habitats they can easily dig burrows.   Population  ------- This species is found across Abu Dhabi Emirate but  in  localised  areas  where  they  can  dig  burrows  as   they  are  a  colonial  species.  Many  populations  have   recently  been  impacted  by  development  projects   VU  Distribution Map Egyptian Spiny-tailed Lizard  (Uromastyx aegyptia)  Local Red List Assessment Category   Vulnerable A2cd  Global Red List Assessment   2018 Vulnerable (VU)  Assessors   Mohamed  A.  Soorae  P. and a population decline of 30 %. They are recorded  in Abu Dhabi’s protected areas and there are healthy  populations  in  the  Al  Houbara  Protected  area  and   Barqa  Al  Soqour  Protected  areas  of  Abu  Dhabi’s   western region.    Population Trend  ------- The populations are decreasing.  Threats  ------- The  Spiny-tailed  lizard  habitat  is  being  lost  due  to   overgrazing   human  settlement   large-scale  agri- cultural  expansion  and  land  reclamation.  In  the   region this species is harvested for the international  pet  trade   medicinal  use  and  is  reputed  to  have   aphrodisiac properties.  Conservation Actions Underway  ------- There  is  a  UAE  wide  genetic  project  underway   which  is  trying  to  determine  the  genetic  status  of   populations  within  the  UAE.  This  will  hopefully   enable  us  to  make  decisions  on  any  mitigation   actions  involving  the  relocation  of  species.  This   species is protected under Federal Law 24 of 1999  and Local Law 22 of 2005 which prohibits hunting of  this  species.  This  species  is  listed  on  Appendix  II    of CITES. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  147146  Wonder Gecko    (Teratoscincus keyserlingii)  Rationale  -------  Teratoscincus  keyserlingii   has  a  very  localised  and   patchy  distribution  in  an  area  stretching  from    Abu Dhabi city to Dubai and occurs in very scattered  populations  in  Sharjah  and  Ras  Al  Khaimah.  Its   extent  of  occurrence  is  less  than  100  km2  and  the   population  is  suffering  from  habitat  fragmentation.   The predicted population decline is more than 80 %  over  the  next  25  years.  Then  this  species  is   categorised as Critically Endangered (CR).  Distribution  ------- The  species  is  distributed  in  Pakistan   Iran   and   Afghanistan  but  in  the  UAE  it  has  a  very  limited   distribution along the eastern coastal belt.  Population  ------- In  Abu  Dhabi  Emirate  Wonder  Gecko  populations   are  usually  found  along  the  coastal  belt  stretching   from Abu Dhabi airport to Ghantoot on the Dubai  Emirate  border.  EAD  has  recorded  populations  in   <  10  localised  sites.  Nocturnal  surveys  have  shown   that in these localised sites we have in some cases   recorded over 15 individuals. Another unique finding   is  that  in  adjoining  areas  with  similar  habitat    Distribution Map Wonder Gecko  (Teratoscincus keyserlingii)  Local Red List Assessment Category   Critically Endangered A3cd  Global Red List Assessment   2018 Critically Endangered (CR)   Assessors   Mohamed  A.  Soorae  P. characteristics  no  individuals  will  be  observed.  In   some  cases  small  population  pockets  have  been   found  within  industrial  areas  with  lights  and  heavy   machinery disturbance.  Population Trend  ------- The  trend  for  this  species  is  declining  and  the   population  is  predicted  to  decline  by  more  than   80 % over the next 25 years (3 generations) due to  extensive and intensive urban construction currently  ongoing  and  development  planned  in  the  future   across its range.  Threats  ------- Development  habitat fragmentation and predation  from introduced species such as Feral Cats.  Conservation Actions Underway  ------- A  UAE  wide  Wonder  Gecko  Conservation    Action  Plan  was  prepared  after  a  UAE  wide    workshop which identified conservation actions for   this species.  CR 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   4.0 Assessment Results & Species Accounts  149148  36% 40% 4%   4% 8% 8%  The United Arab Emirates have recorded more than 4 000 invertebrate species  out of which almost 2 312  have been recorded in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. For the regional red listing project  we assessed a total  number of 25 species after decisions based on different quantitative criteria to assess the extinction risk of  the given species. Of the assessed species one is Critically Endangered (CR)  two as Vulnerable (VU) and one  as Endangered (EN). The remaining species were assessed as either Near Threatened (NT)  Least Concern   (LC) or Data Deficient (DD).  Systematic monitoring programmes being carried out for scorpion species in protected areas help understand  the current populations are stable or declining  and the status and needs of their habitats.  Establishment  of  various  protected  areas  would  ensure  conservation  of  suitable  habitats  and  to  prevent   disturbance. As far as insect species are concerned  the biotope and host-plant protection are the priority  for conservation. Systematic monitoring of the species  within and outside protected areas is being undertaken   by EAD and achieved in finding ‘new species’ and naming them. Giving a species a name is the first step  towards protecting it from extinction. Once it is identified  efforts to monitor and conserve the species can   be put in place. Ultimately   the  key  to  protection  of  any  species  is  protecting  its  habitat.  Successful  conservation    of invertebrates requires a greater understanding by the general public  scientists and conservationists of the  extraordinary  value  that  these  organisms  provide.  In  order  to  accomplish  this  goal   public  education   programmes are being carried out to enhance the recognition of invertebrates’ positive values  and indeed   of all biological diversity.   4.6  Conservation Status of Invertebrates   in Abu Dhabi Emirate    Anitha Saji & Zamzam Alrashdi  Introduction  Figure 4.6.1  Status of   invertebrate species assessed.

The invasive species  of  birds  feed  on  the  species  (Indian  Mynah)    unregulated  collection  and  spraying  of  pesticides   could also affect.  Conservation Actions Underway  ------- Protection of habitat has already been implemented   in the Jabal Hafit National Park of the Abu Dhabi   Emirate.  Control  of  invasive  species   protection  of   breeding habitats and plant species  restrictions on  pesticides were ensured where these species occur. 
The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species 158  Abu Dhabi is home to around to 436 species of vascular plants. Using IUCN Red list categories and criteria   assessment of plants species have been done in order to prioritise the species for conservation management.   Conservation assessment has been done for 101 plant species during the first phase. No species are in   regionally  extinct  category.  Eight  species  are  Critically  Endangered  (CR)   11  species  are  Endangered  (EN)    four are Vulnerable (VU)  18 species are Near Threatened (NT)  46 species are of Least Concern (LC) and   13 species are Data Deficient (DD). Many of our native plant species have small population size and restricted   distribution. Climate change  deforestation  increasing urban development and over grazing are some of the   key threats to the flora in the region.  Conservation actions of flora in the region include  in-situ  approaches such as protected areas and natural  reserves and  ex-situ  approaches such as seed banks and plant nurseries. Species-specific action plan have been   prepared for species such as Dwarf palm ( Nannorrhops ritchieana )  White saxaul ( Haloxylon persicum )  Ghaf  ( Prosopis cineraria ) and Samr ( Vachellia tortilis ). Regular monitoring of many species have also been carried out either as part of the implementations of the  action plans or as part of the continuous monitoring for habitats and species associated with it . However   further monitoring and research activities are recommended in order to have a better understanding of the  population trends of the species. These diverse conservation approaches can not only help in saving plant  species in danger but also helps in widening our knowledge base of these species which can in turn pave way  for their sustainable use.  4.7  Conservation Status of Plants   in Abu Dhabi Emirate    Sabitha Sakkir & Maher Kabshawi  Introduction  Figure 4.7.1  Status of   plant species assessed.

The Abu Dhabi Red List of Species   5.0 Next Steps 211210  5.1  Prioritising Conservation Action for  Threatened Species  As indicated in the regional guidelines (IUCN  2012b) the assessment of extinction risk and setting conservation  priorities  are  two  related  but  different  processes.  Assessment  of  extinction  risk  generally  precedes  the   setting of priorities  and has the purpose of estimating extinction risk by following rules that are objective   transparent and repeatable. Setting conservation priorities  on the other hand  which normally includes the  assessment of extinction risk  also takes into account other factors such as ecological  phylogenetic  historical   or  cultural  preferences  for  some  taxa  over  others   as  well  as  the  probability  of  success  of  conservation   actions  availability of funds or personnel to carry out such actions  and legal frameworks for conservation of  threatened taxa (Miller  et al.   2006; Miller  et al.   2007).  Extinction Risk  Regional extinction risk  global  extinction risk  Distributional Factors  Global significance of natinoal  populations  current vs past  distribution/abundance patterns  Biological Factors  Taxonomic uniqueness  taxonomic  level  link to eccosystem services   keystone species status  Societal Values  Cultural importance  public appeal   educational value  flagship species  status  Logistical Factors  Type of action required  feasibility   urgency  conflicting issues  adequacy  of data  Economic Factors  Cost of action  species economic  value  potential economic loss if  protected  Other Factors  Government or NGO involvement   action required by existing  agreement or legislation  Conservation PrioritiesWeighting System  In the context of regional risk assessments  a number of additional pieces of information are valuable for setting  conservation priorities. For example  it is important to consider not only conditions within the region but also  the status of the taxon from a global perspective and the proportion of the global population that occurs within  the  region.  Consequently   it  is  recommended  that  any  publication  that  results  from  a  regional  assessment   process  should  include  at  least  three  measures   (1)  the  regional  Red  List  Category   (2)  the  global  Red  List   Category  and (3) an estimate of the proportion ( %) of the global population occurring within the region. Future steps in Abu Dhabi are to identify species or groups of species that will be the focus of the development  of action plans  and mobilise the resources required to implement them. The ultimate purpose of this effort  is to improve the status of threatened species and reduce extinction risk in the emirate.  5.2 Red Listing of Ecosystems  Following the publication of Abu Dhabi Red List of Species  EAD will continue to partner with IUCN SSC and   Provita towards the development of the Red List of Ecosystems (RLE)  a framework for identification of   ecosystems at risk (Rodríguez  et al.   2015; Keith  et al.   2013)  similar to the Red List of Species. Development of  Red List of Ecosystems is a logical next step  not only to establish threatened ecosystems but also to understand  how species status are connected to the state of their habitats. The process proposed to take this forward is  similar to the one described in this publication and would be jointly undertaken by EAD and Provita team.  5.3  Integrating Species and Ecosystem Red  Lists into Spatial Conservation Planning  Red list of species combined with the Red list of ecosystems provide an ideal platform for spatial conservation   planning and provide a robust and scientifically sound basis for protection of species  habitats and ecosystem    by preventing and diverting any incompatible land use and developmental activities away from important and  mostly biologically rich and diverse areas. As the current habitat maps are in the process of being revised and a new habitat maps are likely to be ready   by mid 2020  it will be possible to measure change over the past five years  and use this information to assign   risk categories. Combined with time series of satellite images available to EAD  as well as projections for   future human development  predictions of ecosystem change can be refined. This will be also framed within   the EAD Strategy (2021-2025) soon to be published. Integration of the RLE and RLS within EAD strategy  would further inform biodiversity conservation priorities for the emirate.  5.4 Developing Red List Indices  One of the most powerful applications of Red Lists if to repeat the assessment periodically  every 5-10 years  to calculate Red List Indexes (RLI) – an average measure of extinction risk of a group of species (Butchart    et al.   2007; Bubb  et al.   2009). If all species in a group are LC  RLI is equal to one  while if all of them are EX   the value of RLI is zero. A method known as backcasting  also allows for inferring the past status of species  and  estimating  their  past  Red  List  category  without  needing  to  wait  5-10  years  for  a  future  assessment.   Development of RLI for Abu Dhabi’s species will be the focus of future analyses.Figure 5.1.1  Conservation action priorities
